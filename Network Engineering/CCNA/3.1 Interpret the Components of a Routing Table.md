# **Routing Fundamentals & Subnetting**

## **Theory in Short**
Routing is the process by which routers move data between different networks. Every device in a network communicates using **MAC addresses (Layer 2)** and **IP addresses (Layer 3)**. Routers use a **routing table** to decide where to send packets. If a device sends data to a different network, it first sends it to a **default gateway** (the router). The router then looks at its **routing table** and forwards the packet accordingly.

Key Concepts:
- **Routing Table**: The router's "map" of known destinations.
- **Static Routes**: Manually configured paths for network traffic.
- **Default Route**: The fallback route when no specific route exists.
- **Connected Routes**: Routes created automatically for networks directly linked to the router.
- **Local Routes**: Identifies the router’s own IP addresses.
- **Next-Hop Routing**: The process of forwarding packets step by step through different routers.

## **Flowchart**
```
Start
  │
  ├── Device sends a packet
  │    ├── Is the destination in the same network?
  │    │    ├── Yes → Send directly to the destination MAC address
  │    │    └── No → Send to the default gateway (router)
  │
  ├── Router receives the packet
  │    ├── Checks routing table for the destination network
  │    │    ├── Found? → Forward to the next hop
  │    │    └── Not found? → Drop packet (or use default route if available)
  │
  ├── Next router receives the packet
  │    ├── Repeat routing table lookup
  │    └── Continue forwarding until destination is reached
  │
  └── Packet arrives at the destination
```
