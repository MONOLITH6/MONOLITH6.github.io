## Theory in Short

### Simple Explanation
This section covers **how devices communicate in a network using MAC and IP addresses**.  
- Every device has a **MAC address** (hardware address), and networks use **IP addresses** (logical addresses) to find devices.
- Switches use **MAC addresses** to forward messages within the same network (Layer 2).
- Routers use **IP addresses** to forward messages between different networks (Layer 3).
- IP addresses (IPv4) are **32-bit numbers**, broken into 4 parts (like 192.168.1.1). Each part can be 0 to 255.
- Networks have **a network portion** (identifies the network) and a **host portion** (identifies the specific device).
- Some addresses are reserved, like:
    - 0.0.0.0 (default)
    - 127.0.0.1 (loopback)
    - 255.255.255.255 (broadcast)

Switches keep track of which devices are connected to which port using a **MAC address table**. Routers use **routing tables** to decide where to send packets.

The **ping** command checks if two devices can talk to each other.

### 2. Short Answers
2.1 The MAC address table stores device MAC addresses and the switch ports they are connected to.  
2.2 Unicast is one device talking to one device; broadcast is one device talking to all devices on the network.  
2.3 The ARP table stores IP-to-MAC mappings so devices know how to send packets.  
2.4 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 — 254 usable addresses.  
2.5 Each interface connects to a different network, so each must have a unique IP address.

### 5. Oral Answer (Layman’s Terms)
MAC addresses are like **house addresses within an apartment building**—they are specific to each device (like each apartment). IP addresses are like **street addresses**—they are used to find which building (network) the message should go to.  
- **MAC = device-specific (apartment number)**  
- **IP = location on the larger internet (street address)**  
Switches use MAC addresses to deliver messages inside the building.  
Routers use IP addresses to deliver messages between buildings.
