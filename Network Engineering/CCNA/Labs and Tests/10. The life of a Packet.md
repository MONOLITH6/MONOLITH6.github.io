## Theory in Short

### Simple Explanation

When a device (like PC1) wants to send data to another device (like PC3), the data travels through **routers and switches**, which are network devices that help forward data to the correct location.

- **Switches** learn the "addresses" (MAC addresses) of devices directly connected to them.
- **Routers** figure out the best path to send the data to a different network.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** helps devices find each other's MAC addresses so data can be sent.

The **packet** is like a letter with an **IP address** (the destination) written on it, but the **envelope (frame)** needs a **MAC address** (the next stop). Each step, the router or switch replaces the envelope, like a new shipping label, so the packet keeps moving toward the final destination.

This whole process involves:
- Learning where things are (ARP)
- Switching (within the same network)
- Routing (between networks)

## Basic TXT Flowchart

```
PC1 sends packet to PC3
   |
   v
Is PC3 on the same network?
   |
   No - Send to default gateway (Router R1)
   |
   v
Use ARP to find R1 MAC address
   |
   v
Send frame to Switch SW1
   |
   v
Switch forwards to R1
   |
   v
R1 checks routing table for next hop (R2)
   |
   v
R1 uses ARP to find R2 MAC address
   |
   v
Send frame to R2
   |
   v
R2 checks routing table for next hop (R3)
   |
   v
R2 uses ARP to find R3 MAC address
   |
   v
Send frame to R3
   |
   v
R3 checks routing table - sees PC3 is directly connected
   |
   v
R3 uses ARP to find PC3 MAC address
   |
   v
Frame sent to PC3
```

### 5. Oral Answer (Layman‚Äôs Terms)

Sending a packet between networks is like mailing a package across different cities. You know the **address (IP)** of the person you're sending to, but at each post office (router), they change the **shipping label (MAC address)** to match the next post office down the line. Each post office figures out the next stop using its map (routing table), and when the package finally gets to the local post office, it gets the label for the final home address. ARP is like calling the post office to ask for the exact delivery person (MAC address) for the next step.

|--------|------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| PC1    | NIC              | 192.168.1.11/24    | Default GW: 192.168.1.1 |

### üîß Step-by-Step Configuration

#### ‚úÖ PC1 and PC3 (VPCS):
```bash
# PC1
ip 192.168.1.11 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1

# PC3
ip 192.168.3.11 255.255.255.0 192.168.3.1
```

#### ‚úÖ R1 Configuration
```bash
conf t
hostname R1
interface g0/1
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface g0/0
 ip address 192.168.12.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2
```

#### ‚úÖ R2 Configuration
```bash
conf t
hostname R2
interface g0/0
 ip address 192.168.12.2 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface g0/1
 ip address 192.168.23.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.1
ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.23.2
```

#### ‚úÖ R3 Configuration
```bash
conf t
hostname R3
interface g0/0
 ip address 192.168.23.2 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
interface g0/1
 ip address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.23.1
```

#### ‚úÖ SW1 and SW2 Configuration (Optional):
Switches can be left in default mode (IOSv-L2) ‚Äì they will flood unknown MACs and forward known unicast traffic.

---

### üß™ Testing the Flow

1. From **PC1**, run:
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.3.11
   ```

2. On **R1**, **R2**, and **R3**, verify routing and ARP:
   ```bash
   show ip route
   show arp
   ```

3. On **SW1** and **SW2**, verify MAC learning:
   ```bash
   show mac address-table
   ```

4. On **PC3**, confirm receipt of ICMP request:
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.11
   ```

---

### üìã What to Observe

- **MAC table learning** on switches (observe broadcast ‚Üí then unicast)
- **ARP resolution** at each hop (PC1 ‚Üí R1, R1 ‚Üí R2, etc.)
- **Routing decisions** using most specific routes
- **Encapsulation/decapsulation** of frames at every router
- **Frame addressing changes at each hop**, while packet destination stays the same

---

### üß† Advanced Follow-Up

- Clear ARP cache on routers and re-ping to see ARP in action:
  ```bash
  clear arp
  debug arp
  ```

- Use `packet capture` in GNS3 between links to visually inspect MAC/IP headers.
