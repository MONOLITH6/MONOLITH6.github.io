# **Theory in Short**  
Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is an evolution of the original Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), designed to prevent network loops while improving convergence speed. Unlike STP, which can take up to 50 seconds to converge, RSTP uses a synchronization mechanism that allows switches to react faster (in some cases, under 6 seconds). RSTP also introduces new port roles (alternate and backup) and states (discarding, learning, forwarding) to optimize performance.  

Cisco’s implementation of RSTP is called **Rapid PVST+**, which runs a separate spanning tree instance for each VLAN. This offers flexibility but increases complexity in large networks. To reduce overhead, **Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP)** groups VLANs into fewer instances, improving efficiency.  

RSTP classifies links as **point-to-point, shared, or edge**, which determine how quickly a port transitions into forwarding mode. Optional features like **Root Guard, Loop Guard, and BPDU Filter** add additional stability and security to spanning tree operations.

**2. Short Answer Questions**  
2.1 STP prevents network loops by ensuring there is only one active path between switches.  
2.2 It remains in blocking mode but can quickly transition to forwarding if the root port fails.  
2.3 MSTP reduces the number of spanning tree instances, improving efficiency in large VLAN environments.  
2.4 STP has four states (blocking, listening, learning, forwarding), whereas RSTP merges blocking/listening into "discarding" and uses a sync mechanism for faster transitions.  
2.5 BPDU Guard prevents rogue switches from affecting the network by disabling a PortFast-enabled port if a BPDU is received.

**5. Oral Answer (Simplified Explanation)**  
Think of STP like traffic lights at intersections—it makes sure cars (data) don’t crash by blocking some roads. But STP is slow, like a traffic light that takes 50 seconds to change. RSTP is like a smart traffic system with sensors—it quickly finds a new route (alternate ports) if a road is blocked, cutting wait times to a few seconds. It keeps data moving smoothly without causing crashes (loops).

#  Lab

### **Cisco Packet Tracer Lab Walkthrough: Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)**
This lab will guide you through setting up **Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)** in **Cisco Packet Tracer**. You will configure switches, verify spanning tree states, and test network behavior during topology changes.

---

## **Lab Objectives**
1. **Set up a network with multiple switches**
2. **Configure RSTP on all switches**
3. **Verify the spanning tree roles and states**
4. **Test convergence after a topology change**
5. **Implement optional RSTP features (Root Guard, Loop Guard, BPDU Filter)**

---

## **Lab Topology**
- **Devices Required:**
  - **3 Cisco 2960 Switches**
  - **3 PCs**
  - **Ethernet cables**

**Network Design:**
- **SW1** is the root bridge.
- **SW2** and **SW3** are connected redundantly.
- PCs are connected to the switches to simulate real-world devices.

```
         [ PC1 ]
            |
            |  Fa0/1
          [SW1] ---- Fa0/2 ---- [SW2]
            |  \                |
            |   \ Fa0/3         | Fa0/4
          Fa0/4  \              |
          [SW3] ---- Fa0/5 ---- [SW2]
            |
            |  Fa0/6
         [ PC2 ]
```

---

## **Step 1: Setting Up the Network**
1. **Open Cisco Packet Tracer.**
2. **Drag and drop three Cisco 2960 switches (SW1, SW2, SW3) into the workspace.**
3. **Drag and drop two PCs (PC1, PC2).**
4. **Connect the devices as follows using Ethernet cables:**
   - **PC1 to SW1 Fa0/1**
   - **PC2 to SW3 Fa0/6**
   - **SW1 Fa0/2 to SW2 Fa0/2**
   - **SW1 Fa0/3 to SW3 Fa0/3**
   - **SW2 Fa0/4 to SW3 Fa0/5**

---

## **Step 2: Configuring Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)**
1. **Access each switch and enter global configuration mode.**  
   - Open the CLI for SW1 and enter:
   ```
   enable
   configure terminal
   spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
   exit
   ```
   - Repeat the same command on SW2 and SW3.

2. **Verify RSTP is enabled:**
   ```
   show spanning-tree
   ```
   - Look for the output:
     ```
     Spanning tree enabled protocol rstp
     ```

---

## **Step 3: Setting SW1 as the Root Bridge**
On **SW1**, configure it as the root bridge:
```
enable
configure terminal
spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
exit
```
- This forces SW1 to become the **root bridge**.

Verify:
```
show spanning-tree
```
- SW1 should have **"This bridge is the root"** in the output.

---

## **Step 4: Checking Spanning Tree Roles and Port States**
On **SW2 and SW3**, check their port roles:
```
show spanning-tree
```
- You should see:
  - **Root Port (RP)** on the fastest path to the root bridge (SW1).
  - **Designated Ports (DP)** forwarding traffic.
  - **Alternate Ports (AP)** blocking redundant links.

---

## **Step 5: Simulating a Topology Change**
To see RSTP in action:
1. **Disconnect the link between SW1 and SW2.**
2. **Run `show spanning-tree` again.**
3. **RSTP should reconverge within seconds**, and an alternate port should become active.

---

## **Step 6: Configuring Optional Features**
### **1. Enable Root Guard (Prevents an unauthorized root bridge)**
On **SW1**, apply **Root Guard** to ports facing SW2 and SW3:
```
enable
configure terminal
interface fa0/2
spanning-tree guard root
interface fa0/3
spanning-tree guard root
exit
```
- If another switch tries to become the root bridge, it will be blocked.

### **2. Enable Loop Guard (Prevents loops due to missing BPDUs)**
On **SW2 and SW3**, apply **Loop Guard** on redundant ports:
```
enable
configure terminal
interface fa0/4
spanning-tree guard loop
interface fa0/5
spanning-tree guard loop
exit
```
- This ensures that if a port stops receiving BPDUs, it won’t mistakenly transition to forwarding.

### **3. Enable BPDU Filter (Prevents STP BPDUs on end-user ports)**
On **ports connected to PCs**, disable STP:
```
enable
configure terminal
interface fa0/1
spanning-tree bpdufilter enable
interface fa0/6
spanning-tree bpdufilter enable
exit
```
- This prevents the PCs from interfering with the spanning tree.

---

## **Step 7: Final Verification**
1. **Check that RSTP is working correctly:**
   ```
   show spanning-tree
   ```
   - Ensure the correct **Root, Designated, and Alternate** ports.

2. **Test Connectivity**
   - Ping **PC1 to PC2** (`ping 192.168.1.2`).
   - **Disable a link** and verify that RSTP quickly restores connectivity.

---

## **Expected Outcomes**
- **SW1 is the root bridge.**
- **Ports are assigned correct roles (Root, Designated, Alternate).**
- **Rapid convergence occurs when a link fails.**
- **Root Guard prevents unauthorized root election.**
- **Loop Guard prevents loops when BPDUs stop.**
- **BPDU Filtering disables STP on end-user ports.**

---

## **Conclusion**
This lab demonstrated how to:
- Configure **Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)**
- Set a **Root Bridge**
- Verify **Spanning Tree roles and states**
- Test **Rapid Convergence**
- Implement **RSTP Security Features** (Root Guard, Loop Guard, BPDU Filter)
