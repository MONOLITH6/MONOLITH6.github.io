# Theory in short

### What is Subnetting?
Subnetting is a way to split a large IP network into smaller, more manageable pieces called **subnets**. This helps conserve IP addresses and improves network organization.

### Why do we need it?
In the old days, networks came in just 3 sizes (Classes A, B, C), and most were either too big or too small. Subnetting gives flexibility by letting you create **networks that are just the right size**.

### Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
CIDR (pronounced "cider") lets you cut networks into any size by using **prefix lengths**, like `/26` or `/30`, instead of only `/8`, `/16`, or `/24`.

### How does subnetting work?
You "borrow" bits from the **host part** of the address to create smaller subnets. Each subnet has its own:

- **Network address** (first IP in the subnet)
- **Broadcast address** (last IP in the subnet)
- **Usable addresses** (everything in between)

### Fixed vs. Variable Subnetting
- **Fixed-Length Subnet Masking (FLSM)** creates all subnets the same size.
- **Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)** creates subnets in different sizes to fit your needs.

### Example
If you split a **/24 network (256 IPs)** into **/26 subnets (64 IPs each)**, you get **4 smaller networks**.

#### 5.1
**Subnetting Simplified (Analogy)**  
Imagine a big apartment building with 256 rooms (IP addresses). If you only need 50 rooms for one business and 20 for another, it’s wasteful to reserve a whole floor (classful addressing). Subnetting lets you break the building into **just-right sections** so each group gets only what they need. You divide up the space efficiently, and each group has their own hallway (subnet) where they can talk to each other without bothering other groups.
