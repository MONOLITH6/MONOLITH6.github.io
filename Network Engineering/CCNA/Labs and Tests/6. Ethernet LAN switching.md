# Theory in Short

This chapter introduces the Cisco IOS Command-Line Interface (CLI) and its essential functions. The CLI is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with Cisco devices such as routers and switches. Network devices can be accessed through:
1. **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** – A visual method of managing devices (e.g., Cisco Wireless LAN Controller).
2. **CLI (Command-Line Interface)** – A text-based approach requiring users to input commands.

The CLI has different **modes**:
- **User EXEC Mode (`Router>`):** Provides basic commands but does not allow configuration.
- **Privileged EXEC Mode (`Router#`):** Allows access to system commands and troubleshooting tools.
- **Global Configuration Mode (`Router(config)#`):** Enables modifications to the device’s configuration.

To access a Cisco device's CLI, users can:
1. **Connect via Console Port** (Physical connection using cables like USB or RJ45).
2. **Connect via Network (Telnet/SSH)** (Remote access over a network).

Cisco devices use **configuration files**:
- **Running Configuration (`running-config`)** – Stores the current system settings (temporary; lost after reboot).
- **Startup Configuration (`startup-config`)** – Saves permanent settings that persist after reboot.

Cisco IOS also allows **password protection** for security:
- **Enable Password:** Basic password (stored in clear text, not secure).
- **Enable Secret:** More secure, uses encryption.

A key feature of networking is **MAC Address Learning and Switching**:
- Switches **learn MAC addresses** from devices and forward packets based on stored information.
- If a switch **does not know a MAC address**, it **floods** the packet to all ports except the source.
- The **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** helps devices find MAC addresses using IP addresses.

### Oral Answer (Layman’s Explanation)  
A switch learns where devices are by remembering where messages come from. Think of it like a mailman who writes down where letters come from so that future mail can be delivered directly without asking every house. If the switch doesn’t know where to send a message, it gives a copy to everyone, like shouting a name in a crowded room until the right person answers.

# Lab
Awesome! Here’s your **GNS3 Lab Walkthrough for Chapter 6 – MAC Address Table & Password Encryption**.

---

## 🧪 Chapter 6 GNS3 Lab: MAC Address Table + Passwords

### 🎯 **Objectives**
- Understand and manipulate the MAC address table
- Secure the CLI with passwords
- Use helpful CLI shortcuts and filtering

---

### 🛠️ **Lab Topology**
**Devices:**
- 1x Cisco Router (C3725 or C7200)  
- 1x Cisco Router or VPCS (as host to generate MAC entries)  
- 1x Switch (Use `NM-16ESW` module on a 3725/3640 or IOU L2 switch)

**Connections:**
```
[Host PC] <----> [Switch] <----> [Router]
```

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Lab Tasks

---

#### ✅ 1. Basic Setup and Console Access

1. Drag a router (with NM-16ESW if needed)
2. Add a second router or VPCS host
3. Connect:
   - Host `Fa0/0` → Switch `Fa0/1`
   - Router `Fa0/0` → Switch `Fa0/2`

---

#### ✅ 2. Verify MAC Table Functionality

**On the switch:**
```bash
Switch> enable
Switch# show mac-address-table
```

✅ You should see empty or limited output.

---

#### ✅ 3. Generate MAC Entries

**Configure interfaces:**

On Router:
```bash
Router> enable
Router# conf t
Router(config)# interface fa0/0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# exit
```

On Host (or second router):
```bash
ip 10.0.0.2/24 10.0.0.1
```

✅ Ping from host to router to populate the MAC table:
```bash
Host# ping 10.0.0.1
```

Then go back to switch:
```bash
Switch# show mac address-table
```

---

#### ✅ 4. Clear Specific MAC Addresses

```bash
Switch# clear mac address-table dynamic
Switch# show mac address-table
```

Try clearing by interface or address:
```bash
Switch# clear mac address-table dynamic interface fa0/1
Switch# clear mac address-table dynamic address <mac>
```

---

#### ✅ 5. Password Security

```bash
Switch(config)# enable password cisco123
Switch(config)# enable secret securepass
Switch(config)# service password-encryption
Switch(config)# do show running-config | include enable
```

Then test:
```bash
Switch# write
Switch# disable
Switch> enable
Password: securepass
```

---

#### ✅ 6. CLI Help & Shortcuts

Try:
```bash
Switch# ?
Switch# sh ?
Switch# show mac ?
Switch# show running-config | include enable
```

Also try:
- `do show clock`
- `show c?`
- `<Tab>` completion

---

### 🧠 Challenge Task (Optional)
Plug/unplug interfaces and try to figure out how fast the switch relearns MAC addresses.  
Also, simulate password cracking by viewing config before and after `service password-encryption`.
