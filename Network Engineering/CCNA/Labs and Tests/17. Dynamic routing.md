## Theory in Short

### What is Dynamic Routing?
Dynamic routing is a way for routers to share information automatically to figure out the best paths for sending data across a network. Instead of an administrator manually setting routes (static routing), routers use a protocol to talk to each other and update their paths.

### Why is Dynamic Routing Better?
1. **Adaptability** – If a link goes down, dynamic routing can find a new path automatically, unlike static routes that stay the same.
2. **Scalability** – In big networks, setting up static routes for every connection is impossible. Dynamic routing makes managing large networks easier.

### Types of Routing Protocols:
1. **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP)** – Used within a single organization.
   - **Distance-vector protocols** (RIP, EIGRP) – Each router only knows its neighbors' information.
   - **Link-state protocols** (OSPF, IS-IS) – Routers build a full map of the network.
2. **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)** – Used between different organizations (e.g., Border Gateway Protocol - BGP).

### How a Router Picks the Best Route:
1. **Metric** – A number that represents how good a route is. Lower is better.
   - RIP: Hop count (fewer hops = better)
   - OSPF: Bandwidth-based cost
   - EIGRP: Mix of bandwidth, delay, etc.
2. **Administrative Distance (AD)** – If multiple protocols suggest a route, the one with the lowest AD wins.
   - Directly connected routes: 0
   - Static routes: 1
   - EIGRP: 90
   - OSPF: 110
   - RIP: 120
   - BGP: 20 (External), 200 (Internal)

### Extra Features:
- **ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path)** – If two routes are equally good, the router splits traffic between them.
- **Floating Static Routes** – A backup route with a higher AD that only activates if the main route fails.
- **The `network` Command** – Used to enable routing protocols on a router.

   ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
   no shutdown
   exit

   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252
   no shutdown
   exit

   interface GigabitEthernet0/2
   ip address 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.252
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

3. **Select R3** and configure its interfaces:
   ```bash
   enable
   configure terminal
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   ip address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0
   no shutdown
   exit

   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   ip address 10.0.1.2 255.255.255.252
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Configure PCs**
1. Click **PC1**, go to **Desktop > IP Configuration**, and set:
   - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.2
   - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0
   - **Default Gateway**: 192.168.1.1

2. Click **PC2**, set:
   - **IP Address**: 192.168.2.2
   - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0
   - **Default Gateway**: 192.168.2.1

3. Click **PC3**, set:
   - **IP Address**: 192.168.3.2
   - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0
   - **Default Gateway**: 192.168.3.1

---

## **Step 4: Configure OSPF on Routers**
1. **Enable OSPF on R1**:
   ```bash
   enable
   configure terminal
   router ospf 1
   network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
   network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
   exit
   ```

2. **Enable OSPF on R2**:
   ```bash
   enable
   configure terminal
   router ospf 1
   network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
   network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
   network 10.0.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
   exit
   ```

3. **Enable OSPF on R3**:
   ```bash
   enable
   configure terminal
   router ospf 1
   network 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
   network 10.0.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
   exit
   ```

---

## **Step 5: Verify OSPF Configuration**
1. **Check OSPF neighbors**:
   ```bash
   show ip ospf neighbor
   ```
   You should see adjacent routers listed.

2. **Check the OSPF routing table**:
   ```bash
   show ip route
   ```
   You should see `O` routes (OSPF-learned routes).

3. **Test connectivity using ping**:
   - From **PC1**, open the command prompt and ping **PC3**:
     ```bash
     ping 192.168.3.2
     ```
   - The ping should be successful if OSPF is working.

---

## **Step 6: Simulate a Link Failure**
1. **Disable the link between R1 and R2**:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   shutdown
   exit
   ```
2. **Check OSPF re-routing**:
   ```bash
   show ip route
   ```
   - OSPF should find a new path via R3.

3. **Re-enable the link**:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

---

## **Lab Summary**
- **Configured OSPF** on a three-router network.
- **Established OSPF neighbor relationships**.
- **Verified dynamic routing** using `show ip route`.
- **Simulated link failure** and observed OSPF adapt.

---

### **Next Steps**
- Try **modifying OSPF costs** (`ip ospf cost <value>`) to influence routing.
- Configure **floating static routes** as a backup.
- Add more routers and test OSPF behavior in **larger topologies**.
