## Theory in Short

### What is Dynamic Routing?
Dynamic routing is a way for routers to share information automatically to figure out the best paths for sending data across a network. Instead of an administrator manually setting routes (static routing), routers use a protocol to talk to each other and update their paths.

### Why is Dynamic Routing Better?
1. **Adaptability** – If a link goes down, dynamic routing can find a new path automatically, unlike static routes that stay the same.
2. **Scalability** – In big networks, setting up static routes for every connection is impossible. Dynamic routing makes managing large networks easier.

### Types of Routing Protocols:
1. **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP)** – Used within a single organization.
   - **Distance-vector protocols** (RIP, EIGRP) – Each router only knows its neighbors' information.
   - **Link-state protocols** (OSPF, IS-IS) – Routers build a full map of the network.
2. **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)** – Used between different organizations (e.g., Border Gateway Protocol - BGP).

### How a Router Picks the Best Route:
1. **Metric** – A number that represents how good a route is. Lower is better.
   - RIP: Hop count (fewer hops = better)
   - OSPF: Bandwidth-based cost
   - EIGRP: Mix of bandwidth, delay, etc.
2. **Administrative Distance (AD)** – If multiple protocols suggest a route, the one with the lowest AD wins.
   - Directly connected routes: 0
   - Static routes: 1
   - EIGRP: 90
   - OSPF: 110
   - RIP: 120
   - BGP: 20 (External), 200 (Internal)

### Extra Features:
- **ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path)** – If two routes are equally good, the router splits traffic between them.
- **Floating Static Routes** – A backup route with a higher AD that only activates if the main route fails.
- **The `network` Command** – Used to enable routing protocols on a router.
