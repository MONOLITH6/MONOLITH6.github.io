## Theory in Short

### 📘 Simple Explanation:
IPv6 routing works much like IPv4 but with a few twists:
- **No ARP** in IPv6 — instead, it uses **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)**.
- NDP helps devices find each other's MAC addresses, find routers, and make sure they aren’t using the same IP.
- IPv6 routers build **routing tables** and forward packets based on the most specific match (longest prefix match).
- You can configure **static routes** in different ways: with just a next hop, just an interface, or both.
- **Link-local addresses** are like local nicknames used only within a single network link.
- You can also set **default routes** (::/0) and **floating static routes** (backup routes with higher administrative distance).

│   └── Fully Specified → next-hop + interface
│
└── Special Topics
    ├── Link-Local Next Hops → need exit interface
    └── Floating Routes → backup routes with higher AD

1.5 B  
1.6 C  
1.7 D  
1.8 C  
1.9 C  
1.10 A  

### 2. Short Answer
2.1 RA informs hosts of available routers and provides network prefix info.  
2.2 It sends an NS to its own solicited-node multicast and waits for a response.  
2.3 Connected = route to a network; Local = route to the interface IP.  
2.4 Because Ethernet uses MAC addresses, and no Proxy-NDP exists in IPv6.  
2.5 Link-local is a special address for local communication and next-hop use.

### 5. Oral Answer  
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is like a new student asking “Who’s the teacher?” and “Is this seat taken?” When a device joins the network, it asks nearby routers for info (Router Solicitation), listens for their reply (Router Advertisement), and double-checks that no one else is using its IP address (DAD). If no one responds, it knows it’s safe to use the IP.

# Lab
Here’s a **step-by-step GNS3 lab walkthrough** based on **Chapter 21 – IPv6 Routing** from *Acing the CCNA Exam: Volume 1*. This lab covers Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), route types, static routes (recursive, directly connected, fully specified), link-local next hops, and floating static routes.

---

## 🔬 Lab Title: IPv6 Routing with NDP and Static Routes

---

## 🎯 Objectives:
- Understand how IPv6 uses NDP
- Observe Neighbor Solicitation/Advertisement and Router Solicitation/Advertisement
- Configure and verify recursive, directly connected, and fully specified static routes
- Use link-local addresses as next hops
- Implement a floating static route

---

## 🛠️ Topology:

```
PC1 --- R1 --- R2 --- R3 --- PC3
         |       |       |
       G0/0    G0/1    G0/1
```

- **R1 G0/0** ↔ **PC1** (2001:db8:1::/64)
- **R1 G0/1** ↔ **R2 G0/0** (2001:db8:12::/64)
- **R2 G0/1** ↔ **R3 G0/0** (2001:db8:23::/64)
- **R3 G0/1** ↔ **PC3** (2001:db8:3::/64)

---

## 🧩 Devices:
- 3 Cisco Routers (IOSv or c7200)
- 2 VPCS nodes (for PC1 and PC3)

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Walkthrough:

### 🔹 Step 1: Basic Setup
Assign interfaces and IPs.

#### R1
```bash
conf t
ipv6 unicast-routing
interface g0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:1::1/64
 ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local
 no shutdown
!
interface g0/1
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:12::1/64
 ipv6 address fe80::12 link-local
 no shutdown
```

#### R2
```bash
conf t
ipv6 unicast-routing
interface g0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:12::2/64
 ipv6 address fe80::2 link-local
 no shutdown
!
interface g0/1
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:23::1/64
 ipv6 address fe80::21 link-local
 no shutdown
```

#### R3
```bash
conf t
ipv6 unicast-routing
interface g0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:23::2/64
 ipv6 address fe80::3 link-local
 no shutdown
!
interface g0/1
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:3::1/64
 ipv6 address fe80::31 link-local
 no shutdown
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Configure VPCS
#### PC1
```bash
ipv6 2001:db8:1::10/64
gateway 2001:db8:1::1
```

#### PC3
```bash
ipv6 2001:db8:3::10/64
gateway 2001:db8:3::1
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Configure Static Routes

#### R1 – Fully specified route to PC3
```bash
ipv6 route 2001:db8:3::/64 g0/1 2001:db8:12::2
```

#### R2 – Fully specified routes
```bash
ipv6 route 2001:db8:1::/64 g0/0 2001:db8:12::1
ipv6 route 2001:db8:3::/64 g0/1 2001:db8:23::2
```

#### R3 – Fully specified route to PC1
```bash
ipv6 route 2001:db8:1::/64 g0/0 2001:db8:23::1
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Verify Routing Tables
```bash
show ipv6 route
show ipv6 route static
```

Check for:
- Local and Connected routes (`L`, `C`)
- Static routes (`S`)

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Test End-to-End Connectivity
From **PC1**:
```bash
ping6 2001:db8:3::10
```

From **PC3**:
```bash
ping6 2001:db8:1::10
```

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Use `show ipv6 neighbors`
On **R1** after pings:
```bash
show ipv6 neighbors
```

You should see both global and link-local entries for R2.

---

### 🔹 Step 7: Test Link-local Next Hop

Try replacing global next hop with link-local (must be fully specified):

#### R1
```bash
ipv6 route 2001:db8:3::/64 g0/1 fe80::2
```

(Assuming fe80::2 is R2's link-local)

---

### 🔹 Step 8: Configure Floating Static Route on R1

```bash
ipv6 route ::/0 2001:db8::2
ipv6 route ::/0 2001:db8:1::2 2
```

- Shut down the interface to simulate failure and test:
```bash
interface g0/0
shutdown
```
- Check routing table again:
```bash
show ipv6 route
```

---

## 🧠 Concepts Reinforced
- NDP behavior and messages (verify with `debug ipv6 icmp`)
- Static route types and troubleshooting
- Link-local addressing requirements
- IPv6 routing table structure
- Longest prefix match and route selection
