# Theory in short
### Understanding Cisco CLI and Network Device Configuration

A Cisco device can be configured using a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** or a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. While GUIs are user-friendly, CLIs are preferred for network configuration due to their efficiency and detailed control.

To access the CLI of a Cisco device, you can connect:
- **Via Console Port** using a cable directly from a PC.
- **Remotely** via Telnet or Secure Shell (SSH) over the network.

When working in the CLI, different **modes** are available:
1. **User EXEC Mode (Router>)** â€“ Limited commands, mostly for viewing information.
2. **Privileged EXEC Mode (Router#)** â€“ Provides access to advanced commands.
3. **Global Configuration Mode (Router(config)#)** â€“ Used to make configuration changes.
4. **Other Configuration Modes (e.g., Interface, Line, etc.)** â€“ Used for specific settings.

Cisco IOS devices use two configuration files:
- **Running-config** (in RAM): Stores the current configuration, lost after reboot.
- **Startup-config** (in NVRAM): Stored settings that persist after reboot.

Security measures include setting **enable passwords** and **enable secrets** to restrict unauthorized access. Enable passwords can be stored in plaintext or encrypted, while enable secrets are hashed for better security.

1.3 B  
1.4 B  
1.5 B  
1.6 C  
1.7 C  
1.8 B  
1.9 A  
1.10 B  

2.1 Console port, SSH/Telnet  
2.2 User EXEC is limited, Privileged EXEC allows configuration  
2.3 Enable secret is hashed, making it more secure  
2.4 write erase  
2.5 Allows execution of EXEC mode commands from configuration mode  

3.1 A1, B2, C3  
3.2 A2, B3, C1, D4  
3.3 A1, B2, C3, D4, E5  

4.1 A, B, D  
4.2 A, B, C  

5.1 A Cisco device saves its configuration in two files: running-config (active but lost on reboot) and startup-config (saved permanently). This ensures that the device retains its settings after a restart, similar to how a smartphone keeps its settings even when turned off.
