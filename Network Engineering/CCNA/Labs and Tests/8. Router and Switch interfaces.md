# Tests

## Theory in short

Routing is how **packets travel between different networks** using routers. Every device in a network has an **IP address**. When a device wants to send data to another device:

- If it's on the same network, it sends directly.
- If it‚Äôs on a different network, it sends the data to the **default gateway** (usually a router).
- The router uses its **routing table** to figure out where to send the packet next.

There are different types of **routes**:
- **Connected routes**: Automatically learned by routers for directly connected networks.
- **Local routes**: For the router‚Äôs own interface IPs.
- **Static routes**: Manually configured by administrators.
- **Default route**: A catch-all path used when no other route matches (like a ‚Äúsend all unknown traffic here‚Äù rule).

| **Feature / Type**                     | A. **Recursive Static Route**                          | B. **Directly Connected Static Route**               | C. **Fully Specified Static Route**                | D. **Default Route**                               | E. **Local Route**                                   |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Syntax**                             | `ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2`      | `ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 g0/0`            | `ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 g0/0 192.168.12.2` | `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.12.2`             | Automatically added (no manual command)                |
| **Specifies Next-Hop IP?**             | ‚úÖ Yes                                                 | ‚ùå No                                               | ‚úÖ Yes                                            | ‚úÖ Yes                                             | ‚ùå No                                                    |
| **Specifies Exit Interface?**          | ‚ùå No                                                  | ‚úÖ Yes                                              | ‚úÖ Yes                                           | ‚úÖ Optional (interface or IP or both)              | ‚úÖ Yes (automatically tied to local interface)           |
| **Routing Table Behavior**             | 2 lookups: destination & next-hop IP                   | Treats destination as directly connected             | Uses both next-hop & interface (no recursion)     | Catch-all fallback route                          | Matches only the router‚Äôs own IP address                |
| **Requires Proxy ARP?**                | ‚ùå No                                                  | ‚úÖ Yes (if next-hop isn‚Äôt directly reachable)       | ‚ùå No                                            | ‚ùå No                                              | ‚ùå No                                                    |
| **ARP Entries Needed**                 | One (for next-hop IP)                                  | One per destination host in the network              | One (for next-hop IP)                             | One (for next-hop IP)                             | One (for local IP, used for diagnostics, ping replies)   |
| **Best Use Case**                      | Typical route type used in enterprise networks         | Avoid unless proxy ARP is enabled and reliable       | Recommended where precision is needed             | Internet or unknown destination forwarding         | Router processing traffic **to itself** (e.g., management) |
| **Potential Issues**                   | Recursive lookup can slightly affect performance       | Wastes ARP table space; may fail if proxy ARP is off | Slightly longer config                            | Becomes dangerous if misconfigured (can route everything away) | Can cause confusion if misunderstood in routing table     |
| **Performance Impact**                 | Low (extra table lookup)                               | Medium (more ARP lookups and memory use)             | Low                                              | Low                                               | None                                                     |
| **Routing Table Code**                 | `S` (Static)                                           | `S` (Static)                                         | `S` (Static)                                      | `S*` (Static Default)                             | `L` (Local)                                              |
| **Example**                            | `ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2`       | `ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 g0/0`            | `ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 g0/0 192.168.12.2` | `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.12.2`           | Shown in routing table as `L 192.168.1.1/32 is directly connected` |

### Oral Question
**Answer**:  
Routing is like sending a letter. Imagine you live in an apartment and want to send a letter to someone in another city. If they‚Äôre in your building, you just hand it to them directly. If they‚Äôre in another city, you take it to the post office (that‚Äôs your router). The post office checks the address (routing table), figures out the best route, and sends it along. If it doesn‚Äôt know the destination, it throws it away. A router does the same ‚Äî it looks at the IP address and finds the best match in its routing table to forward the packet.
