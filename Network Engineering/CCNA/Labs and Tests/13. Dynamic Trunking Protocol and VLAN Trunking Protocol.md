| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `switchport mode access`            | Configures the port as an **access port** (does not allow trunking).                                |
| `switchport mode trunk`             | Configures the port as a **trunk port** (allows multiple VLANs).                                    |

| `show interfaces trunk`             | Shows **active trunk links** and **VLANs allowed** on those trunks.                                 |
| `dir flash:` or `show flash:`       | Displays **files in flash memory**, including `vlan.dat` (stores VLAN database).                    |
| `delete flash:vlan.dat`             | **Deletes the VLAN database** (resets VLAN configuration).                                          |
| `show spanning-tree`                | Checks **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) status**, useful when troubleshooting trunk issues.           |

These commands will help configure, verify, and troubleshoot **DTP and VTP** on Cisco switches. ðŸš€


## **Theory in Short**
Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) and VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) are two Cisco-proprietary protocols used in networking.

- **DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol):**  
  - Helps Cisco switches automatically decide whether a port should act as an **access port** (for end devices) or a **trunk port** (to carry multiple VLANs).
  - Uses **DTP messages** to negotiate with neighboring switches.
  - Security risk: Attackers can trick a switch into creating a trunk and gain access to multiple VLANs.
  - **Best practice:** Disable DTP using `switchport nonegotiate`.

- **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol):**  
  - Allows switches to **synchronize VLAN configurations** automatically.
  - VLANs are stored in a **database (vlan.dat)**.
  - Uses **VTP messages** to share VLAN updates.
  - Can accidentally overwrite VLAN configurations if a switch with a higher revision number is added.
  - **Best practice:** Use **VTP version 3**, which introduces **primary servers** to control changes.

### **5. Oral Answer (Laymanâ€™s Terms)**
Imagine you have multiple departments in a building, and you want to keep their conversations separate while allowing some to communicate when needed.  

- **DTP** is like a security guard at a door that checks if the people walking in need access to one room (access mode) or multiple rooms (trunk mode). Sometimes, attackers can trick the guard into letting them into all rooms.  
- **VTP** is like an automated system that updates all rooms with the same directory. If one directory is wrong, it can mess up every room. The best way to fix this is to have **one official directory manager (VTP v3 Primary Server)** who controls updates.

# LAB
## **Lab Walkthrough: Simulating DTP and VTP in Cisco Packet Tracer**

### **Objective**
In this lab, you will configure **Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)** and **VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)** on Cisco switches using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The goal is to:
- Configure and verify **DTP** negotiation between switches.
- Configure and test **VTP** synchronization.
- Secure switch ports by disabling **DTP**.
- Test VLAN propagation using **VTP**.

---

### **Lab Topology**
You will need **three switches (SW1, SW2, SW3)** and **three PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3)** connected as follows:

```
                [PC1]
                  â”‚
                  â”‚
        +-----------------+
        |      SW1        |
        | VTP Server Mode |
        +-----------------+
            â”‚       â”‚
            â”‚       â”‚
       +-----------------+       +-----------------+
       |      SW2        |-------|      SW3        |
       | VTP Client Mode |       | VTP Client Mode |
       +-----------------+       +-----------------+
           â”‚                        â”‚
         [PC2]                    [PC3]
```

---

### **Step 1: Setup the Network in Packet Tracer**
1. **Open Cisco Packet Tracer.**
2. **Drag and drop three switches (Switch-2960).**
3. **Drag and drop three PCs (PC-PT).**
4. **Connect the devices using Copper Straight-Through cables** as follows:
   - **PC1 â†’ SW1 (FastEthernet0/1)**
   - **PC2 â†’ SW2 (FastEthernet0/1)**
   - **PC3 â†’ SW3 (FastEthernet0/1)**
   - **SW1 GigabitEthernet0/1 â†’ SW2 GigabitEthernet0/1**
   - **SW1 GigabitEthernet0/2 â†’ SW3 GigabitEthernet0/1**
   - **SW2 GigabitEthernet0/2 â†’ SW3 GigabitEthernet0/2**

---

### **Step 2: Configure Basic Switch Settings**
Perform these commands on **SW1, SW2, and SW3**.

#### **On All Switches:**
1. Enter privileged mode:
   ```bash
   enable
   ```
2. Enter global configuration mode:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   ```
3. Set hostnames:
   ```bash
   hostname SW1  # Do the same for SW2 and SW3
   ```
4. Disable domain lookup (prevents DNS resolution delays):
   ```bash
   no ip domain-lookup
   ```
5. Assign an IP address to each switchâ€™s **VLAN 1** (for testing):
   ```bash
   interface vlan 1
   ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0  # Change for each switch
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Configure VLANs and Trunking**
#### **On SW1 (VTP Server)**
1. Set up VLANs:
   ```bash
   vlan 10
   name HR
   vlan 20
   name IT
   vlan 30
   name Finance
   exit
   ```
2. Assign VLANs to PC ports:
   ```bash
   interface FastEthernet0/1
   switchport mode access
   switchport access vlan 10
   exit
   ```
3. Configure **trunk links**:
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   switchport mode dynamic desirable
   exit

   interface GigabitEthernet0/2
   switchport mode dynamic desirable
   exit
   ```

#### **On SW2 (VTP Client)**
1. Assign VLANs to PC ports:
   ```bash
   interface FastEthernet0/1
   switchport mode access
   switchport access vlan 20
   exit
   ```
2. Configure **trunk link**:
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   switchport mode dynamic auto
   exit

   interface GigabitEthernet0/2
   switchport mode dynamic desirable
   exit
   ```

#### **On SW3 (VTP Client)**
1. Assign VLANs to PC ports:
   ```bash
   interface FastEthernet0/1
   switchport mode access
   switchport access vlan 30
   exit
   ```
2. Configure **trunk link**:
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   switchport mode dynamic auto
   exit

   interface GigabitEthernet0/2
   switchport mode dynamic auto
   exit
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Configure VTP**
#### **On SW1 (VTP Server)**
1. Set VTP mode and domain:
   ```bash
   vtp mode server
   vtp domain LabNetwork
   vtp password Cisco123
   ```
2. Verify:
   ```bash
   show vtp status
   ```

#### **On SW2 and SW3 (VTP Clients)**
1. Set VTP mode and domain:
   ```bash
   vtp mode client
   vtp domain LabNetwork
   vtp password Cisco123
   ```

2. Verify that VLANs are synchronized:
   ```bash
   show vlan brief
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Disable DTP on Ports**
To prevent security risks, disable DTP on unused ports.

#### **On All Switches**
1. **Disable DTP on access ports**:
   ```bash
   interface FastEthernet0/1
   switchport mode access
   switchport nonegotiate
   exit
   ```

2. **Disable DTP on trunk ports**:
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   switchport nonegotiate
   exit

   interface GigabitEthernet0/2
   switchport nonegotiate
   exit
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Verify Configurations**
1. **Check DTP negotiation results on SW1**:
   ```bash
   show interfaces trunk
   ```
2. **Check VLANs on all switches**:
   ```bash
   show vlan brief
   ```
3. **Check VTP status**:
   ```bash
   show vtp status
   ```
4. **Check trunk links**:
   ```bash
   show interfaces GigabitEthernet0/1 switchport
   ```
   Look for **Operational Mode: Trunk**.

---

### **Step 7: Test Connectivity**
1. Open **Command Prompt on PC1** and ping PC2 and PC3.
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.2
   ping 192.168.1.3
   ```
   - If VLANs are configured correctly, PCs in different VLANs **should NOT** communicate.
   - If VLANs are the same and trunking works, they **should communicate**.

---

### **Step 8: Troubleshooting**
If pings fail:
- Check if VLANs exist on all switches:
  ```bash
  show vlan brief
  ```
- Check if trunk links are active:
  ```bash
  show interfaces trunk
  ```
- Verify VTP synchronization:
  ```bash
  show vtp status
  ```
- Make sure access ports are correctly assigned to VLANs.

---

âœ… Configured **VTP** for VLAN synchronization.  
âœ… Disabled **DTP** for security.  
âœ… Verified VLAN propagation.
