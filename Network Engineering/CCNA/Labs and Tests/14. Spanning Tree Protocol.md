# Theory in Short  
### Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Simplified  
STP is like traffic control for network switches. Imagine a roundabout with multiple roads. If all roads are open, cars (network traffic) could get stuck in an endless loop. STP works like a traffic officer, blocking some roads to prevent cars from endlessly circling. It ensures that only one active road (path) exists between any two points, avoiding traffic jams (network loops).

2.4 Redundancy provides backup connections in case of failure but can create Layer 2 loops if unmanaged.

### **Oral Question Answer**  
STP is like a train system with multiple tracks. If all tracks were open at the same time, trains could crash into each other (network loops). STP is like a traffic control system that closes some tracks, making sure trains take the safest path without collisions.

# **Cisco Packet Tracer Lab Walkthrough: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Implementation**

#### **Objective:**
- Understand how STP prevents Layer 2 loops.
- Configure STP on Cisco switches.
- Observe STP behavior and port roles.
- Implement PortFast and BPDU Guard for access ports.

---

### **Lab Topology**
#### **Devices Required:**
- **3 Cisco 2960 Switches** (SW1, SW2, SW3)
- **2 PCs** (PC1, PC2)
- **Cables:** Copper straight-through for PC-to-Switch connections, Copper crossover for Switch-to-Switch connections.

#### **Network Diagram:**
```
          [PC1]                          [PC2]
             |                               |
        (F0/1)                          (F0/1)
          SW1 --------- SW2 --------- SW3
            \                         /
             \----------------------/
```
---
### **Step 1: Setting Up the Network**
1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Drag **3 Cisco 2960 switches** onto the workspace.
3. Drag **2 PCs** onto the workspace.
4. Connect the devices:
   - **PC1 to SW1 (F0/1)** using a **straight-through cable**.
   - **PC2 to SW3 (F0/1)** using a **straight-through cable**.
   - **SW1 to SW2 (F0/2 to F0/2)** using a **crossover cable**.
   - **SW2 to SW3 (F0/3 to F0/3)** using a **crossover cable**.
   - **SW1 to SW3 (F0/4 to F0/4)** using a **crossover cable**.

---
### **Step 2: Configuring STP on the Switches**
1. **Access each switch via CLI**:
   - Click on a switch.
   - Go to the **CLI** tab.
   - Type `enable` to enter privileged mode.

2. **Set SW1 as the root bridge**:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 0
   exit
   ```

3. **Verify the root bridge election**:
   ```bash
   show spanning-tree
   ```
   - Look for the **Root ID** section. The switch with the lowest **Bridge ID** (Priority + MAC Address) is the root bridge.
   - If SW1 is correctly set as the root bridge, it should display:  
     ```
     This bridge is the root
     ```

4. **Check STP port states on all switches**:
   ```bash
   show spanning-tree
   ```
   - Ports should show different roles: **Root Port (RP), Designated Port (DP), and Blocking (BLK)**.

---
### **Step 3: Testing STP Blocking State**
1. **Observe the port blocking behavior**:
   - One of the links between **SW1, SW2, and SW3** should be in the **Blocking** state to prevent loops.
   - Use:
     ```bash
     show spanning-tree
     ```
   - Identify which port is **Blocking**.

2. **Disconnect the Blocking Link**:
   - Disconnect the cable of the blocking port.
   - Wait for STP to **recalculate** and unblock an alternative path.
   - Re-run:
     ```bash
     show spanning-tree
     ```
   - Verify that another port has moved to **Forwarding** state.

---
### **Step 4: Configuring PortFast & BPDU Guard**
1. **Enable PortFast on Access Ports (PC1 and PC2 connections)**:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface fastethernet 0/1
   spanning-tree portfast
   exit
   ```

2. **Enable BPDU Guard on Access Ports**:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface fastethernet 0/1
   spanning-tree bpduguard enable
   exit
   ```

3. **Test BPDU Guard**:
   - **Incorrectly connect SW1 F0/1 to SW2 F0/1** (Instead of PC).
   - Run:
     ```bash
     show spanning-tree
     ```
   - The port should enter **err-disabled state**.

4. **Recover the disabled port**:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface fastethernet 0/1
   shutdown
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

---
### **Step 5: Testing Network Connectivity**
1. **Assign IP addresses to PCs**:
   - Click **PC1**, go to **Desktop > IP Configuration**, and set:
     ```
     IP Address: 192.168.1.1
     Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
     ```
   - Click **PC2**, set:
     ```
     IP Address: 192.168.1.2
     Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
     ```

2. **Ping from PC1 to PC2**:
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.2
   ```
   - If STP is working correctly, the connection should be successful.

---
### **Step 6: Summary of Commands Used**
| **Command** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| `show spanning-tree` | Displays STP status, roles, and port states. |
| `spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 0` | Sets the switch as the root bridge. |
| `spanning-tree portfast` | Enables PortFast on an access port. |
| `spanning-tree bpduguard enable` | Enables BPDU Guard to disable ports receiving BPDUs. |
| `shutdown` / `no shutdown` | Disables and re-enables a port. |

---
### **Completion & Expected Outcome**
By the end of this lab, you should:
âœ… Understand **how STP prevents Layer 2 loops**.  
âœ… Identify **root ports, designated ports, and blocked ports**.  
âœ… Configure **PortFast and BPDU Guard** to optimize network performance.  
âœ… Verify that **STP recalculates the topology** when a failure occurs.
