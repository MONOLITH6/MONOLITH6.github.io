## Theory in Short
### Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Simplified
OSPF is a routing protocol used inside networks to find the best way to send data. It works like a GPS system that constantly updates maps and finds the shortest path between locations.

1. **How it Works:**
   - OSPF routers become neighbors by exchanging "Hello" messages.
   - They share information about network connections using Link-State Advertisements (LSAs).
   - Each router creates a map of the network (Link-State Database - LSDB).
   - Using Dijkstra’s Algorithm, routers calculate the shortest path to each destination.

2. **OSPF Areas:**
   - To make large networks efficient, OSPF divides them into areas.
   - The backbone area (Area 0) connects all other areas.
   - This reduces unnecessary updates and speeds up route calculations.

3. **OSPF Metrics:**
   - OSPF uses **cost** to decide the best route.
   - Cost is based on link speed (faster links have lower cost).
   - Default reference bandwidth is 100 Mbps; higher bandwidth links need manual adjustments.

4. **OSPF Router Types:**
   - **Internal Router**: Stays in one area.
   - **Backbone Router**: Has an interface in Area 0.
   - **Area Border Router (ABR)**: Connects different areas.
   - **Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR)**: Connects OSPF to other networks (e.g., the Internet).

5. **OSPF Neighbor Relationships:**
   - Routers go through states (Down → Init → 2-Way → Full Adjacency).
   - Some networks elect a **Designated Router (DR)** to reduce network traffic.
   - Point-to-Point links don’t need a DR and form direct connections.

5.1 **OSPF is like a city map app.** Each router is like a taxi driver who constantly updates their map. They share their updates (LSAs) with other drivers, so everyone knows the best way to get from point A to B. Instead of guessing routes, they always take the shortest, fastest path using this shared map.


# Lab
### **GNS3 OSPF Lab Walkthrough**

This lab will help you understand and practice configuring **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)** in **GNS3** using Cisco routers. You will configure OSPFv2 in a single-area network, establish neighbor relationships, manipulate costs, and verify routes.

---

## **Lab Objectives**
1. **Set up a GNS3 topology** with 4 routers.
2. **Configure OSPF on all routers** in a single area (Area 0).
3. **Verify OSPF neighbor relationships.**
4. **Adjust OSPF costs** to influence routing decisions.
5. **Configure a default route** on the Internet-connected router.

---

## **Step 1: GNS3 Topology Setup**
### **Devices Required:**
- **4 Cisco Routers** (e.g., c7200 or c3725)
- **3 Ethernet Switches** (optional, if using multi-access networks)
- **PC (optional, for testing connectivity)**

### **Network Diagram**
```
       [R1] -------- [R2]
         |             |
         |             |
       [R3] -------- [R4]
```
- **Router R1**: Connects to **R2** and **R3**.
- **Router R2**: Connects to **R1** and **R4**.
- **Router R3**: Connects to **R1** and **R4**.
- **Router R4**: Connects to **R2** and **R3**.

### **IP Addressing Plan**
| **Router** | **Interface** | **IP Address**      | **Subnet Mask** |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| R1 | G0/0 | 10.0.0.1 | 255.255.255.252 |
| R1 | G0/1 | 10.0.0.5 | 255.255.255.252 |
| R2 | G0/0 | 10.0.0.2 | 255.255.255.252 |
| R2 | G0/1 | 10.0.0.9 | 255.255.255.252 |
| R3 | G0/0 | 10.0.0.6 | 255.255.255.252 |
| R3 | G0/1 | 10.0.0.13 | 255.255.255.252 |
| R4 | G0/0 | 10.0.0.10 | 255.255.255.252 |
| R4 | G0/1 | 10.0.0.14 | 255.255.255.252 |

---

## **Step 2: Basic Router Configuration**
### **On Each Router**
1. Set a hostname:
   ```bash
   Router(config)# hostname R1
   ```
2. Configure interfaces with the correct IP:
   ```bash
   R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   R1(config-if)# ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
   R1(config-if)# no shutdown
   ```

Repeat for all interfaces on **all routers**.

---

## **Step 3: Configuring OSPF**
1. Enter OSPF configuration mode:
   ```bash
   R1(config)# router ospf 1
   ```
2. Configure networks in Area 0:
   ```bash
   R1(config-router)# network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
   R1(config-router)# network 10.0.0.4 0.0.0.3 area 0
   ```

Repeat for all routers, adjusting IPs accordingly.

---

## **Step 4: Verify OSPF Neighbors**
After configuring all routers, verify neighbor relationships:
```bash
R1# show ip ospf neighbor
```
You should see a table of **neighboring routers** with their **Router ID** and **state**.

---

## **Step 5: Adjust OSPF Costs**
By default, OSPF assigns a **cost** based on bandwidth. You can manually change it:
```bash
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
R1(config-if)# ip ospf cost 50
```
- Lower **cost** = Preferred route.

Verify costs:
```bash
R1# show ip ospf interface
```

---

## **Step 6: Configuring a Default Route (On R1)**
If **R1 is connected to an external network (e.g., Internet)**, configure a default route:
```bash
R1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# default-information originate
```
Verify default route propagation:
```bash
R2# show ip route
```

---

## **Step 7: Test Connectivity**
1. **Check the OSPF routing table:**
   ```bash
   R1# show ip route ospf
   ```
2. **Ping between routers:**
   ```bash
   R1# ping 10.0.0.10
   ```
3. **Check OSPF database:**
   ```bash
   R1# show ip ospf database
   ```

---

## **Step 8: Save Configuration**
Save your work on each router:
```bash
R1# write memory
```

---

### **Expected Results**
- All routers should form **OSPF neighbor relationships**.
- The **shortest path should be preferred** based on cost.
- The **default route should be advertised** and available in routing tables.
- Pings between routers should succeed.
