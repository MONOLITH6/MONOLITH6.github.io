# **Theory in Short**
EtherChannel is a technology that combines multiple physical links into a **single logical link** to improve network bandwidth, redundancy, and efficiency. Without EtherChannel, **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** blocks redundant links to prevent loops, but this wastes bandwidth. EtherChannel allows **all links to remain active** while being treated as a **single connection**, avoiding STP blocking.

EtherChannel can be **static** (manually set) or **dynamic**, using protocols like **PAgP (Cisco-only)** or **LACP (industry standard)**. It also supports **Layer 2 (switching frames)** and **Layer 3 (routing packets)** configurations.

EtherChannel uses **load balancing** to distribute traffic across links efficiently. However, settings like **speed, VLANs, and duplex mode must match** on all member ports, or the EtherChannel wonâ€™t form.

### **Oral Question Answer**  
**EtherChannel is like a multi-lane highway.** Imagine a road with **only one lane**â€”traffic gets slow because all cars use the same path. If we **add more lanes**, more cars can move at the same time, **reducing congestion**. However, each car still moves at the same speed limit. Similarly, EtherChannel increases **bandwidth** by combining multiple links but doesnâ€™t make each link itself faster. It also **prevents STP from blocking redundant paths**, keeping all links **active and efficient**.

# Lab
### **Cisco Packet Tracer Lab Walkthrough: Configuring EtherChannel**

This lab will guide you through setting up **EtherChannel** in **Cisco Packet Tracer**. You will configure both **static** and **dynamic** EtherChannel using **PAgP** and **LACP**, verify the configuration, and understand how load balancing works.

---

## **Lab Objectives**
1. **Create a network topology with multiple switches and PCs**
2. **Configure Static EtherChannel**
3. **Configure Dynamic EtherChannel using PAgP and LACP**
4. **Verify EtherChannel configuration**
5. **Test network behavior using the `show` commands**
6. **Modify load balancing settings and observe the effects**

---

## **Lab Topology**
- **Devices Required:**
  - **3 Cisco 2960 Switches (SW1, SW2, SW3)**
  - **4 PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4)**
  - **Ethernet cables**

**Network Design:**
- **SW1 connects to SW2 with 2 links using Static EtherChannel**
- **SW1 connects to SW3 with 2 links using PAgP (Cisco Proprietary)**
- **SW2 connects to SW3 with 2 links using LACP (IEEE Standard)**
- **Each switch has a PC connected to test connectivity**

```
                     [PC1]    
                       |      
                      SW1         
                   /      \      
          Static /        \ PAgP  
                /          \

              LACP \    /      
                   \  /       
                  [PC2]      
```

---

## **Step 1: Setting Up the Network**
1. **Open Cisco Packet Tracer.**
2. **Drag and drop three Cisco 2960 switches (SW1, SW2, SW3) into the workspace.**
3. **Drag and drop four PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4).**
4. **Connect the devices using Ethernet cables:**
   - **PC1 to SW1 Fa0/1**
   - **PC2 to SW2 Fa0/1**
   - **PC3 to SW3 Fa0/1**
   - **SW1 to SW2 using Fa0/2 and Fa0/3 (Static EtherChannel)**
   - **SW1 to SW3 using Fa0/4 and Fa0/5 (PAgP)**
   - **SW2 to SW3 using Fa0/6 and Fa0/7 (LACP)**

---

## **Step 2: Configuring Static EtherChannel (SW1 â†” SW2)**
Static EtherChannel **does not use** negotiation protocols.

### **On SW1**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface range fa0/2 - 3
channel-group 1 mode on
exit
```

### **On SW2**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface range fa0/2 - 3
channel-group 1 mode on
exit
```

Verify:
```bash
show etherchannel summary
```
- Look for `Po1` interface and ensure the ports are bundled.

---

## **Step 3: Configuring Dynamic EtherChannel (PAgP on SW1 â†” SW3)**
PAgP is **Cisco proprietary** and requires `desirable` mode on one switch and `auto` on the other.

### **On SW1**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface range fa0/4 - 5
channel-group 2 mode desirable
exit
```

### **On SW3**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface range fa0/4 - 5
channel-group 2 mode auto
exit
```

Verify:
```bash
show pagp neighbor
show etherchannel summary
```

---

## **Step 4: Configuring Dynamic EtherChannel (LACP on SW2 â†” SW3)**
LACP is **an open standard** and requires `active` mode on one switch and `passive` on the other.

### **On SW2**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface range fa0/6 - 7
channel-group 3 mode active
exit
```

### **On SW3**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface range fa0/6 - 7
channel-group 3 mode passive
exit
```

Verify:
```bash
show lacp neighbor
show etherchannel summary
```

---

## **Step 5: Configuring Load Balancing**
By default, EtherChannel uses **source and destination IP-based** load balancing. You can change it.

To check the current load-balancing method:
```bash
show etherchannel load-balance
```

To change the load-balancing method (e.g., MAC-based):
```bash
configure terminal
port-channel load-balance src-mac
exit
```

Verify:
```bash
show etherchannel load-balance
```

---

## **Step 6: Testing and Troubleshooting**
1. **Test connectivity between PCs**
   - Assign **IP addresses** to all PCs (e.g., `192.168.1.x/24`).
   - Use **ping** to verify communication (`ping 192.168.1.2` from PC1 to PC2).
   - If pings fail, check the status of EtherChannel with:
     ```bash
     show etherchannel summary
     ```
   
2. **Check if interfaces are bundled**
   ```bash
   show etherchannel summary
   ```
   - Ensure ports have **"P" (bundled in Port-Channel)**.
   
3. **Check PAgP or LACP neighbor status**
   ```bash
   show pagp neighbor
   show lacp neighbor
   ```
   - If EtherChannel isn't forming, verify **mode configurations**.

4. **Check spanning tree state**
   ```bash
   show spanning-tree
   ```
   - EtherChannel should appear as a **single logical link**.

---

## **Expected Outcomes**
- **SW1 â†” SW2 uses Static EtherChannel (`Po1`).**
- **SW1 â†” SW3 uses PAgP (`Po2`).**
- **SW2 â†” SW3 uses LACP (`Po3`).**
- **EtherChannel interfaces show as active (`SU` in `show etherchannel summary`).**
- **Traffic should be balanced across multiple links.**
- **Pings between PCs should work without issues.**

---

## **Conclusion**
This lab demonstrated:
- **Configuring Static and Dynamic EtherChannel (PAgP & LACP)**
- **Verifying EtherChannel operation with `show` commands**
- **Using Load Balancing for efficient traffic distribution**
- **Testing and troubleshooting connectivity issues**

By following these steps, you gain **hands-on experience** with EtherChannel, an important **CCNA topic** that improves network **redundancy, performance, and efficiency**. ðŸš€
