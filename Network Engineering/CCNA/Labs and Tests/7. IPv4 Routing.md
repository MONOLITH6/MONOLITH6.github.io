## Theory in Short

### Simple Explanation
This section covers **how devices communicate in a network using MAC and IP addresses**.  
- Every device has a **MAC address** (hardware address), and networks use **IP addresses** (logical addresses) to find devices.
- Switches use **MAC addresses** to forward messages within the same network (Layer 2).
- Routers use **IP addresses** to forward messages between different networks (Layer 3).
- IP addresses (IPv4) are **32-bit numbers**, broken into 4 parts (like 192.168.1.1). Each part can be 0 to 255.
- Networks have **a network portion** (identifies the network) and a **host portion** (identifies the specific device).
- Some addresses are reserved, like:
    - 0.0.0.0 (default)
    - 127.0.0.1 (loopback)
    - 255.255.255.255 (broadcast)

Switches keep track of which devices are connected to which port using a **MAC address table**. Routers use **routing tables** to decide where to send packets.

The **ping** command checks if two devices can talk to each other.

### 2. Short Answers
2.1 The MAC address table stores device MAC addresses and the switch ports they are connected to.  
2.2 Unicast is one device talking to one device; broadcast is one device talking to all devices on the network.  
2.3 The ARP table stores IP-to-MAC mappings so devices know how to send packets.  
2.4 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 — 254 usable addresses.  
2.5 Each interface connects to a different network, so each must have a unique IP address.

### 5. Oral Answer (Layman’s Terms)
MAC addresses are like **house addresses within an apartment building**—they are specific to each device (like each apartment). IP addresses are like **street addresses**—they are used to find which building (network) the message should go to.  
- **MAC = device-specific (apartment number)**  
- **IP = location on the larger internet (street address)**  
Switches use MAC addresses to deliver messages inside the building.  
Routers use IP addresses to deliver messages between buildings.

### 🧩 **IP Address Scheme**

| Device | Interface     | IP Address        | Netmask           | Notes            |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| PC1    | —             | 192.168.1.2       | 255.255.255.0     | Default GW: .1   |
| R1     | G0/0          | 192.168.1.1       | 255.255.255.0     | LAN1             |
| R1     | G0/1          | 192.168.2.1       | 255.255.255.0     | LAN2             |

---

### 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Lab Setup**

---

### ✅ Step 1: Setup PC1 and PC2 (VPCS)
```bash
# On PC1
VPCS> ip 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1

# On PC2
VPCS> ip 192.168.2.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Configure Router Interfaces
```bash
R1> enable
R1# configure terminal

! G0/0 - LAN1
R1(config)# interface g0/0
R1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# no shutdown

! G0/1 - LAN2
R1(config)# interface g0/1
R1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# no shutdown
R1(config-if)# exit

R1# write
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Verify Configurations
```bash
R1# show ip interface brief
R1# show ip interface g0/0
R1# show ip interface g0/1
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Test Connectivity
From PC1:
```bash
VPCS> ping 192.168.1.1     # R1 G0/0
VPCS> ping 192.168.2.2     # PC2
```

From PC2:
```bash
VPCS> ping 192.168.2.1     # R1 G0/1
VPCS> ping 192.168.1.2     # PC1
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Optional ARP Inspection (Layer 2 insight)
```bash
R1# show arp
```

---

### 🧠 Bonus Challenge Tasks

1. Modify subnet mask from `/24` to `/25` and observe changes in broadcast and usable host range.
2. Try `ping 255.255.255.255` from PC1 and see if it reaches PC2 (it shouldn't).
3. Disable one router interface and observe effect:
   ```bash
   R1(config)# interface g0/1
   R1(config-if)# shutdown
   ```
