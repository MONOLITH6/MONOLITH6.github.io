# Tests
Hereâ€™s a structured breakdown of **First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP)** in **simple terms**, along with a **flowchart**, **quiz questions**, and an **answer key** at the end.

---

# **First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP) - Simplified**
### **What is FHRP?**
- Think of **FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocols)** as a **backup plan for your router**.
- In a **network**, devices need a **default gateway** (a router) to reach the internet.
- But what if that router **fails**? Devices would lose internet access.
- **FHRP solves this by having a backup router ready** to take over automatically.

---

### **How FHRP Works**
1. **Primary Router (Active/Master) Handles Traffic**
   - Normally, all devices send data through one main router.
2. **Backup Router (Standby/Backup) is on Standby**
   - Another router is **ready** but not actively used.
3. **Router Failure Triggers a Switch**
   - If the **main router** fails, the backup router takes over **instantly**.
4. **Devices Are Unaware of the Change**
   - Since the routers share a **virtual IP and MAC address**, devices continue working **without noticing any disruption**.

---

### **Types of FHRP**
| **Protocol** | **Vendor** | **Main Terms** | **Preemption** | **Load Balancing** |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)** | Cisco | Active/Standby | **Disabled by default** | **Per subnet** |
| **VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)** | Open Standard | Master/Backup | **Enabled by default** | **Per subnet** |
| **GLBP (Gateway Load Balancing Protocol)** | Cisco | AVG/AVF | **AVG: Disabled, AVF: Enabled** | **Per host** |

---

### **Flowchart (Text-Based)**
```
Start
  |
  |---> Devices send traffic through Primary Router
  |       |
  |       |---> Backup Router monitors the Primary Router
  |               |
  |               |---> Primary Router fails?
  |                       |
  |                       |---> YES --> Backup Router takes over
  |                       |---> NO  --> Continue as usual
  |                               |
  |                               |---> Devices keep using the same virtual IP

# Lab
Below is a detailed lab walkthrough that you can follow in GNS3 to practice configuring FHRP (using HSRP in this example). In this lab, youâ€™ll set up a simple topology with two routers and one PC (or host) on the same LAN. The routers will use HSRP to provide a redundant default gateway. You can later adapt the lab to test VRRP or GLBP if desired.

---

# **FHRP Lab Walkthrough â€“ Using HSRP in GNS3**

## **Lab Objectives**
1. Set up a basic GNS3 topology with two Cisco routers and one PC.
2. Configure IP addressing and basic settings on both routers.
3. Configure HSRP on the routers to share a virtual IP (VIP) as the default gateway.
4. Verify HSRP neighbor relationships and roles.
5. Simulate a failure and observe failover behavior.

---

## **Topology Overview**

**Diagram:**

```
         +----------+
         |   PC     |
         +----+-----+
              |
           (Switch)
              |
   +----------+----------+
   |                     |
+-----+              +-----+
| R1  |              | R2  |
+-----+              +-----+
```

**IP Addressing:**

- **PC (Default Gateway):** 10.0.0.1 (virtual IP provided by HSRP)
- **R1 â€“ Interface to LAN:** 10.0.0.2/24
- **R2 â€“ Interface to LAN:** 10.0.0.3/24

*Note: The PCâ€™s default gateway is set to the virtual IP 10.0.0.1.*

---

## **Step-by-Step Configuration**

### **Step 1: Build the Topology in GNS3**
1. **Create a New Project.**
2. **Drag and Drop:**
   - Two Cisco routers (for example, Cisco 7200 or Cisco 3725 images).
   - One Ethernet switch.
   - One PC (optional but recommended for connectivity testing).
3. **Connect the Devices:**
   - Connect R1â€™s GigabitEthernet0/0 to the switch.
   - Connect R2â€™s GigabitEthernet0/0 to the switch.
   - Connect the PC to the switch.

---

### **Step 2: Basic Router Configuration**

#### **Router R1 Configuration:**
1. **Set the Hostname and Enable Interfaces:**
   ```bash
   enable
   configure terminal
   hostname R1
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
     ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
     no shutdown
   exit
   ```
2. **Save Configuration:**
   ```bash
   write memory
   ```

#### **Router R2 Configuration:**
1. **Set the Hostname and Enable Interfaces:**
   ```bash
   enable
   configure terminal
   hostname R2
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
     ip address 10.0.0.3 255.255.255.0
     no shutdown
   exit
   ```
2. **Save Configuration:**
   ```bash
   write memory
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Configure HSRP on Both Routers**

#### **On R1:**
1. **Enter Interface Configuration:**
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   ```
2. **Enable HSRP Version 2 and Configure HSRP Settings:**
   ```bash
     standby version 2
     standby 1 ip 10.0.0.1
     standby 1 priority 105
     standby 1 preempt
   ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - `standby version 2`: Enables HSRPv2.
     - `standby 1 ip 10.0.0.1`: Sets HSRP group 1â€™s virtual IP (default gateway for the LAN).
     - `standby 1 priority 105`: Sets R1â€™s priority higher than the default (100) so it becomes the Active router.
     - `standby 1 preempt`: Allows R1 to retake the Active role if it recovers from a failure.
3. **Exit and Save:**
   ```bash
   exit
   write memory
   ```

#### **On R2:**
1. **Enter Interface Configuration:**
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   ```
2. **Configure HSRP Settings:**
   ```bash
     standby version 2
     standby 1 ip 10.0.0.1
     ! (No priority change is needed on R2; default priority is 100)
     ! Preemption is optional on the lower-priority router.
   ```
3. **Exit and Save:**
   ```bash
   exit
   write memory
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Verify HSRP Operation**

1. **On R1, Check HSRP Status:**
   ```bash
   show standby brief
   ```
   - Expected output: R1 should be **Active** with priority 105 and show R2 as the Standby router.

2. **On R2, Check HSRP Status:**
   ```bash
   show standby brief
   ```
   - Expected output: R2 should show as **Standby** with the Active routerâ€™s IP being 10.0.0.2 (R1â€™s address).

3. **On the PC:**
   - Configure the PCâ€™s IP address to be in the same subnet (for example, 10.0.0.10/24) with the default gateway set to **10.0.0.1**.
   - Test connectivity by pinging **10.0.0.1** (the VIP). It should respond to ARP requests using the virtual MAC address.

---

### **Step 5: Simulate Failover**

1. **Simulate a Failure on R1:**
   - On R1, shut down the interface:
     ```bash
     configure terminal
     interface GigabitEthernet0/0
       shutdown
     ```
2. **Observe HSRP on R2:**
   - On R2, run:
     ```bash
     show standby brief
     ```
     - Expected: R2 should now take the Active role.
3. **Test Connectivity:**
   - From the PC, ping **10.0.0.1** again. The traffic should now be forwarded by R2.
4. **Bring R1 Back Online (Optional):**
   - On R1, enable the interface:
     ```bash
     configure terminal
     interface GigabitEthernet0/0
       no shutdown
     ```
   - With preemption enabled on R1, it should reclaim the Active role. Verify with `show standby brief` on both routers.

---

## **Step 6: Additional Verification**

1. **Check ARP Tables on the PC:**
   - Verify that the PCâ€™s ARP table maps the default gateway (10.0.0.1) to the HSRP virtual MAC address.
2. **Monitor HSRP Timers:**
   - Use:
     ```bash
     show standby
     ```
     - This displays detailed information such as hello time and hold time.

---

## **Expected Results**
- **Normal Operation:** R1 is the Active router, R2 is in Standby mode. The PC uses the virtual IP (10.0.0.1) as its default gateway.
- **After R1 Failure:** R2 takes over as Active. Connectivity from the PC continues seamlessly.
- **After R1 Recovery:** With preemption enabled, R1 reclaims the Active role.

---

## **Lab Summary**
- You built a simple topology in GNS3.
- You configured HSRP on two routers to share a virtual IP as a default gateway.
- You verified HSRP status and simulated a failure to observe automatic failover.
- This lab demonstrates how FHRP (using HSRP) ensures network resilience by providing a redundant default gateway.

Feel free to modify and extend this lab (for example, by testing VRRP or GLBP) to further explore FHRP concepts. Happy labbing!

| R5/R6 | Virtual IP | 192.168.3.1 | 255.255.255.0 | Load-Balanced Gateway |

---

## **Step 3: Configure HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)**
### **On R1 (Primary Router)**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 standby version 2
 standby 1 ip 192.168.1.1
 standby 1 priority 110
 standby 1 preempt
 no shutdown
exit
write memory
```

### **On R2 (Backup Router)**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.3 255.255.255.0
 standby version 2
 standby 1 ip 192.168.1.1
 no shutdown
exit
write memory
```
âœ… **Verification Command**: `show standby brief`  
- R1 should be **Active**, and R2 should be **Standby**.  
- If R1 fails, R2 should take over automatically.  

---

## **Step 4: Configure VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)**
### **On R3 (Master Router)**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.2.2 255.255.255.0
 vrrp 1 ip 192.168.2.1
 vrrp 1 priority 110
 no shutdown
exit
write memory
```

### **On R4 (Backup Router)**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.2.3 255.255.255.0
 vrrp 1 ip 192.168.2.1
 no shutdown
exit
write memory
```
âœ… **Verification Command**: `show vrrp`  
- R3 should be **Master**, and R4 should be **Backup**.  
- If R3 fails, R4 should take over automatically.  

---

## **Step 5: Configure GLBP (Gateway Load Balancing Protocol)**
### **On R5**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.3.2 255.255.255.0
 glbp 1 ip 192.168.3.1

 no shutdown
exit
write memory
```

### **On R6**
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.3.3 255.255.255.0
 glbp 1 ip 192.168.3.1
 no shutdown
exit
write memory
```
âœ… **Verification Command**: `show glbp`  
- R5 should be the **Active Virtual Gateway (AVG)**.  
- R6 should be an **Active Virtual Forwarder (AVF)**.  
- Load balancing should be distributed **per-host**.  

---

## **Step 6: Test Failover and Redundancy**
### **Test HSRP Failover**
1. **Run `show standby brief` on R1 and R2** to confirm roles.  
2. **Shut down R1â€™s interface**:
   ```bash
   R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   R1(config-if)# shutdown
   ```
3. **Check R2** (`show standby brief`) â€“ it should now be **Active**.  

### **Test VRRP Failover**
1. **Run `show vrrp` on R3 and R4**.  
2. **Shut down R3â€™s interface**:
   ```bash
   R3(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   R3(config-if)# shutdown
   ```
3. **Check R4** (`show vrrp`) â€“ it should now be **Master**.  

### **Test GLBP Load Balancing**
1. **Run `show glbp` on R5 and R6**.  
2. **Ping 192.168.3.1 from multiple hosts** (`ping -t 192.168.3.1`).  
3. **Check load balancing behavior** (`show mac address-table` on the switch).  

---

## **Step 7: Save Configuration**
```bash
write memory
```
This ensures all routers retain their settings after a reboot.

---

### **Expected Results**
âœ… **HSRP provides gateway redundancy**, with automatic failover.
