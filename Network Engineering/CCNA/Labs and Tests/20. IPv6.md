## Theory in Short

### 🧠 IPv6 in Simple Terms:
Imagine IPv4 as a small box of toy blocks—great when there weren’t many kids, but now the playground is packed. IPv6 is like a giant warehouse of blocks—enough for everyone, even future kids!

### Why IPv6?
- **IPv4 has 4 billion addresses** – not enough for today’s internet-connected world.
- **IPv6 has 340 undecillion addresses** – more than enough for every device on Earth.
- IPv6 addresses are **128 bits long**, while IPv4 are **32 bits**.
- IPv6 uses **hexadecimal format** and looks like `2001:db8::1`.

### Key Concepts:
- IPv6 uses **/64 prefixes**—first 64 bits = network, last 64 bits = host.
- It has different **address types**: Global Unicast, Link-Local, Unique Local, Multicast, and Anycast.
- Devices use **Modified EUI-64** to generate part of their IPv6 address using their MAC address.
- IPv6 has **no broadcast**—instead, it uses **multicast**.
- **Link-local addresses** (like `fe80::`) are always present on interfaces.

### Oral Answer (Layman's Terms):
5.1 IPv4 is like trying to fit everyone in a city into a small hotel—eventually, you run out of rooms. IPv6 is like building an entire city with more than enough houses for everyone now and in the future. It gives each device its own unique address, even your fridge or lightbulb if they’re smart! It’s longer and more complex-looking, but it's just a better way to keep everything connected without running out of space.

# Lab
Here’s a **step-by-step GNS3 lab walkthrough** based on **Chapter 20 – IPv6 Addressing** from *Acing the CCNA Exam: Volume 1*. This lab will help reinforce your understanding of IPv6 configuration, address types, and command usage on Cisco routers.

---

## 🔬 IPv6 Lab Walkthrough in GNS3

### **Lab Title**: IPv6 Configuration and Address Types

---

## ✅ Objectives:
- Enable IPv6 routing on routers  
- Configure manual IPv6 addresses  
- Configure link-local addresses  
- Use EUI-64 to auto-generate host portion  
- Understand multiple IPv6 addresses on a single interface  
- Verify configurations using `show` commands

---

## 🛠 Topology:
```
PC1 ---- R1 ---- R2 ---- PC2
         |       |
         G0/0    G0/1
```

- **R1 G0/0** connects to **PC1**
- **R1 G0/1** connects to **R2 G0/0**
- **R2 G0/1** connects to **PC2**

---

## 🧩 Device Setup:
- **2 Cisco Routers** (e.g., `c7200` or `IOSv`)
- **2 VPCS hosts** or cloud (emulating PC1 and PC2)

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 🔹 Step 1: Add Devices and Links
- Place R1, R2, PC1, and PC2 on your GNS3 workspace.
- Connect:
  - PC1 ↔ R1 (G0/0)
  - R1 (G0/1) ↔ R2 (G0/0)
  - R2 (G0/1) ↔ PC2

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Enable IPv6 Routing on Routers
On **R1 and R2**:
```bash
conf t
ipv6 unicast-routing
exit
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Assign IPv6 Addresses (Manual and EUI-64)

#### R1
```bash
interface g0/0
ipv6 address 2001:db8:1::1/64
no shutdown
exit

interface g0/1
ipv6 address 2001:db8:2::1/64 eui-64
no shutdown
exit
```

#### R2
```bash
interface g0/0
ipv6 address 2001:db8:2::2/64 eui-64
no shutdown
exit

interface g0/1
ipv6 address 2001:db8:3::1/64
ipv6 address 2001:db8:3::2/64
no shutdown
exit
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Assign IPv6 to VPCS
In **PC1**:
```bash
ipv6 2001:db8:1::2/64
gateway 2001:db8:1::1
```

In **PC2**:
```bash
ipv6 2001:db8:3::3/64
gateway 2001:db8:3::1
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Verify IPv6 Addressing

On **R1 and R2**:
```bash
show ipv6 interface brief
```

Check for:
- Global addresses
- Link-local addresses
- EUI-64 generated host portions

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Ping Test
From **PC1**:
```bash
ping6 2001:db8:3::3
```

From **PC2**:
```bash
ping6 2001:db8:1::2
```

---

### 🔹 Step 7: Verify Multicast Group Membership
```bash
show ipv6 interface g0/0
```

Look for:
- FF02::1 (all nodes)
- FF02::2 (all routers)
- FF02::1:FFxx:xxxx (solicited-node multicast)

---

### 🔹 Step 8: Manual Link-Local Address
On **R2 G0/0**:
```bash
ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local
```

Verify:
```bash
show ipv6 interface g0/0
```

---

## 🧠 Optional Challenges:
1. Use `show ipv6 route` to view routing table entries.
2. Configure an anycast address on both R1 and R2 using:
   ```bash
   ipv6 address 2001:db8:100::1/64 anycast
   ```
3. Use `debug ipv6` commands to see neighbor discovery in action.
