### ✅ Table: Commands & Descriptions from Chapter 24

| **Command**                                                    | **Description**                                                                     |     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |

| `ip access-list extended {name number}`                        | Enters **named ACL config mode** to create or edit a named extended ACL.            |     |
| `[seq-num] {permit deny} protocol source destination`          | Adds an ACE in named ACLs; sequence number optional but helps organize entries.     |     |
| `permit ip any any`                                            | Allows all IPv4 traffic from any source to any destination.                         |     |
| `deny udp 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255`            | Blocks UDP traffic from 10.0.0.0/24 to 192.168.1.0/24.                              |     |

| `ip access-group {ACL_NAME ACL_NUMBER} {in out}`               | **Applies an ACL** to an interface in inbound or outbound direction.                |     |
| `no {ACE command}`                                             | In global config mode, deletes **entire** numbered ACL.                             |     |
| `no seq-number`                                                | In named ACL mode, deletes **specific ACE** using its sequence number.              |     |
| `ip access-list resequence {name number} start-seq increment`  | Renumbers ACEs in an ACL for better organization and space between rules.           |     |
| `host IP_ADDRESS`                                              | Used to match a **single host** IP (e.g., `host 192.168.1.1`).                      |     |
| `any`                                                          | Matches **any** IP address (i.e., 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255).                         |     |
| `{eq gt lt neg range}`                                         | Keywords used to match TCP/UDP **port numbers**. Example: `eq 80`, `range 20 21`.   |     |

# Test
Sure! Here's a structured learning pack based on Chapter 24 – **Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs)** from _Acing the CCNA Exam: Volume 1_. It includes simplified explanations, a flowchart, quiz questions, and an answer key.

## Theory in Short

### 🔐 What are Extended ACLs?

Think of ACLs like a security guard at a building entrance. Standard ACLs are like a guard who only checks the *source* of the person (IP address). Extended ACLs, though, are like a smarter guard who checks the *source*, *destination*, *protocol*, and even what the visitor wants to do (like "access web" or "send a file").

### ✍️ What can you control with Extended ACLs?
- Type of traffic (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- Source & destination port numbers

You can be specific like:  
> “Deny HTTP (port 80) traffic from the engineering department to the server room, but allow everything else.”

ACLs are processed **top to bottom**, and the first match is what counts. If no match is found, the packet is denied by default (that’s the implicit deny).

## Answers Key

### Multiple-choice
1.1 C  
1.2 D  
1.3 D  
1.4 B

1.10 C  

### Short Answer
2.1 Wildcard masks define which bits to match. A 0 means “must match,” and 1 means “don’t care.” Used for IP range matching.  
2.2 To stop unwanted traffic early and save bandwidth.  
2.3 If no rules match, the packet is dropped by default—this is implicit deny.  
2.4 “eq” means equal to one port, “range” lets you define a start and end port range.  
2.5 access-list 101 deny tcp 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.1.10 eq 80  

### Match Terms
3.1 A3, B2, C1  
3.2 A1, B2, C3, D4  
3.3 A1, B2, C5, D3, E4  

### Select All That Apply  
4.1 A, B, D  
4.2 A, C, D  

### Oral Answer  
5.1 Extended ACLs are like security guards who not only check where traffic is coming from but also what kind of traffic it is (web, ping, file sharing, etc.). Imagine you only want to let in delivery drivers (HTTP traffic) to the loading dock (server). With extended ACLs, you can write that exact rule. It’s more powerful than just saying "block this IP." You get to say “only allow web traffic from these people to this door.”

# Lab
Absolutely! Here's a **GNS3 Lab Walkthrough** based on **Chapter 24 – Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs)** from _Acing the CCNA Exam: Volume 1_. This lab focuses on understanding, configuring, and verifying **Extended ACLs**, including protocol and port filtering.

---

## 🧪 Lab Title: Extended ACLs with Protocol & Port Filtering in GNS3

### 🧭 Objective:
- Configure extended named and numbered ACLs on Cisco routers.
- Filter traffic based on IP, protocols (ICMP, TCP, UDP), and ports (HTTP, HTTPS, TFTP, etc.).
- Understand the difference between inbound and outbound ACLs.
- Practice editing ACLs using sequence numbers.

---

## 🧱 Topology:

```txt
  [PC1]----[R1]----[R2]----[PC2]
   .1        .254     .253    .2
192.168.1.0/24     192.168.3.0/24
```

> Use GNS3 with 2 Cisco routers (R1, R2) and 2 VPCS (PC1, PC2). Alternatively, use 4 routers if you want to simulate more subnets like engineering/accounting/server LANs.

---

## 🔧 IP Configuration:

### R1:
```bash
interface Gig0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown

interface Gig0/1
 ip address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

### R2:
```bash
interface Gig0/0
 ip address 192.168.3.2 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown

interface Gig0/1
 ip address 192.168.4.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

### PC1:
```bash
ip 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.254
```

### PC2:
```bash
ip 192.168.4.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.4.1
```

Enable routing between routers:
```bash
R1(config)# ip routing
R2(config)# ip routing
```

---

## 🧠 Scenario Tasks

### 🎯 Task 1: Only allow ICMP (ping) between PC1 and PC2

#### Configure on R1 (inbound on G0/0):
```bash
ip access-list extended ICMP_ONLY
 permit icmp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip any any
interface g0/0
 ip access-group ICMP_ONLY in
```

Repeat similar config on R2 to allow traffic from PC2 to PC1.

---

### 🎯 Task 2: Block HTTP (port 80) from PC1 to PC2, allow everything else

```bash
ip access-list extended NO_HTTP
 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80
 permit ip any any
interface g0/0
 ip access-group NO_HTTP in
```

---

### 🎯 Task 3: Deny TFTP (UDP port 69) from PC2 to any IP

```bash
access-list 110 deny udp 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 69
access-list 110 permit ip any any
interface g0/1
 ip access-group 110 in
```

---

### 🛠 Task 4: Edit the ACL (insert a rule using sequence number)

```bash
ip access-list extended NO_HTTP
 5 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255 eq 443
```

This allows HTTPS (port 443) before the HTTP deny is evaluated.

---

### 🛠 Task 5: Resequence the ACL

```bash
ip access-list resequence NO_HTTP 10 10
```

This makes the ACEs 10, 20, 30… so you can insert more later.

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

Run these from **PC1 and PC2** using GNS3 VPCS:

- `ping 192.168.4.2` → Should succeed (ICMP allowed)
- `telnet 192.168.4.2 80` → Should fail (HTTP denied)
- `telnet 192.168.4.2 443` → Should succeed (HTTPS allowed)
- `tftp 192.168.1.1` → Should fail from PC2 (TFTP blocked)

Run from routers:
```bash
show access-lists
show ip interface g0/0
```

---

## 🧽 Cleanup (optional)

Remove ACLs:
```bash
no access-list 110
no ip access-list extended ICMP_ONLY
no ip access-list extended NO_HTTP
```

Remove ACLs from interfaces:
```bash
interface g0/0
 no ip access-group ICMP_ONLY in
```

---

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

- Understand how extended ACLs filter traffic using multiple fields.
- Practice writing ACLs with precision.
- Learn to manage and edit ACLs effectively using sequence numbers.
- Grasp real-world use cases of traffic control at the network layer.
