Let me know if you'd like this in flashcard format or included in your ACL lab walkthrough for GNS3!

Absolutely! Based on **Chapter 23 – Standard Access Control Lists (ACLs)** from *Acing the CCNA Exam: Volume 1*, here is your complete breakdown in professor-style format:

---

## Theory in Short

### 🔐 What Are Standard ACLs in Simple Terms?

Think of ACLs as a **security guard at a doorway** who checks ID cards (IP addresses) and decides who can go through (permit) and who gets turned away (deny). Each rule in the ACL is like a specific instruction for the guard.

Standard ACLs are simple: they only care about **where the packet comes from** (source IP address). The guard doesn’t care where it's going or what’s inside—it only checks the origin.

Key points:
- ACLs filter **incoming (inbound)** or **outgoing (outbound)** traffic.
- ACLs are made up of rules called **Access Control Entries (ACEs)**.
- If a packet doesn’t match any rule, it's denied by default (**implicit deny**).
- You can number ACLs (1–99 or 1300–1999) or give them names.
- The **order of rules matters**—once a match is found, the rest are skipped.
- ACLs don’t work until you **apply them to an interface**.

### Oral Question

5.1 Question: Explain how ACLs work in simple terms using an analogy.

## Answers Key

### 1. Multiple-Choice  
1.1 C  
1.2 B  
1.3 C  
1.4 A  
1.5 C  
1.6 C  
1.7 C  
1.8 B  
1.9 B  
1.10 C  

### 2. Short Answer  
2.1 Standard ACLs filter by source IP only; extended ACLs filter by more parameters (like ports).  
2.2 It’s a default rule that blocks all traffic not explicitly permitted.  
2.3 The specific rule will never be reached—this is called a shadowed rule.  
2.4 It defines which bits must match in the source IP.  
2.5 It means the ACL filters packets as they enter the router through the interface.

### 3. Match Terms

3.1  
A1  
B2  
C3  

3.2  
A1  
B2  
C3  
D4  

3.3  
A1  
B2  
C3  
D4  
E5  

### 4. Select All That Apply  
4.1 A, B, C  
4.2 A, B, D  

### 5. Oral Answer  
ACLs are like bouncers at a club. They check your ID at the door (source IP), and follow a list of rules. If your name (IP) is on the blocklist, you’re denied. If you're allowed, you go in. If you’re not on any list, you’re still denied by default. They don’t care who you’re visiting (destination), just where you’re from.

# Lab
Here’s a **hands-on GNS3 Lab Walkthrough** based on **Chapter 23 – Standard ACLs** from *Acing the CCNA Exam: Volume 1*. This lab will guide you step-by-step through configuring and testing **standard numbered and named ACLs** using a sample network topology.

---

## 🧪 Lab Title: Filtering Traffic Using Standard ACLs

---

- Configure **standard numbered and named ACLs**
- Apply ACLs **inbound** and **outbound**
- Understand the role of **wildcard masks**
- Observe **implicit deny** and **shadowed rules**
- Verify ACLs using `show` commands

---

## 🛠️ GNS3 Lab Topology

```
PC1 (192.168.1.11)      PC2 (192.168.2.17)
    |                         |
    |                         |
  [R1 G0/0]--------------[R2 G0/2]
     |                        |
     |                        |
G0/1                        G0/0
     |                        |
192.168.2.0/24        192.168.3.0/24 (Server LAN A)
                            |
                         [SRV1]
                      192.168.3.50
```

> You’ll need:  
- 2 Cisco routers (IOSv)  
- 2 VPCS (for PC1 and PC2)  
- Optional: 1 cloud or another VPCS for SRV1

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Configuration

### 🔹 Step 1: Basic IP Configuration

#### R1
```bash
conf t
interface g0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
!
interface g0/1
 ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

#### R2
```bash
conf t
interface g0/0
 ip address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
!
interface g0/2
 ip address 192.168.2.2 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```

#### PC1
```bash
ip 192.168.1.11 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
```

#### PC2
```bash
ip 192.168.2.17 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Configure Static Routing

> So routers can reach each other’s LANs.

#### R1
```bash
ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2
```

#### R2
```bash
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Configure Numbered ACL

> Block engineering (192.168.1.0/24) from reaching Server LAN A.

#### R2
```bash
access-list 1 deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 1 permit any
interface g0/0
 ip access-group 1 out
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Configure Named ACL

> Block PC1 and PC2 (Martha and Bob) from reaching any R2 LAN.

```bash
ip access-list standard BLOCK_MARTHA_BOB
 deny 192.168.1.11
 deny 192.168.2.17
 permit any
interface g0/2
 ip access-group BLOCK_MARTHA_BOB in
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Verification

#### From PC1:
```bash
ping 192.168.3.50  → (Should be denied by ACL 1)
```

#### From PC2:
```bash
ping 192.168.3.50  → (Should be permitted by ACL 1, but denied by BLOCK_MARTHA_BOB)
```

#### On R2:
```bash
show access-lists
show ip interface g0/0
show ip access-lists
```

You should see:
- Matches on deny rules
- ACLs applied to interfaces
- Sequence numbers on ACEs

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

- Standard ACLs only match **source IP**
- Order of ACEs matters (shadowed rules)
- **Implicit deny** blocks anything not explicitly permitted
- Named ACLs are easier to **edit and manage**
- Use `any` or wildcard masks to match ranges
