## Theory in short  
Networking models help organize how computers communicate over networks. The **TCP/IP model** is widely used today and consists of five layers:

1. **Physical Layer** â€“ Deals with physical connections like cables, radio signals, and network ports.  
2. **Data Link Layer** â€“ Ensures data moves from one device to another using MAC addresses.  
3. **Network Layer** â€“ Uses IP addresses to send data between devices on different networks.  
4. **Transport Layer** â€“ Uses protocols like TCP and UDP to ensure data gets to the right application.  
5. **Application Layer** â€“ Where user applications interact with the network using protocols like HTTP, FTP, and DNS.  

Data is **encapsulated** when sent (wrapped with headers/trailers) and **de-encapsulated** when received (headers/trailers removed). This allows devices to communicate effectively across networks.

2. **Short Answers**  
2.1. The OSI model is a conceptual framework that helps understand networking functions, even though modern networks use TCP/IP.  
2.2. It uses **port numbers** to identify applications (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443).  
2.3. TCP ensures reliable delivery; UDP is faster but doesn't guarantee delivery.  
2.4. A packet moves from one router to another using IP addresses until it reaches the destination, changing its MAC address at each hop.  
2.5. Encapsulation organizes data in layers, allowing efficient transmission and processing.

5. **Oral Question - Simple Explanation**  
Networking works like sending a package through a postal system.  
- The **Application Layer** writes the letter (data).  
- The **Transport Layer** ensures itâ€™s sent in an envelope with a tracking number (port number).  
- The **Network Layer** assigns the recipientâ€™s address (IP address).  
- The **Data Link Layer** hands it off to the correct delivery truck (MAC address).  
- The **Physical Layer** moves the package using trucks, planes, or ships (cables, Wi-Fi signals).  
At the destination, the process is reversed (de-encapsulation), and the recipient reads the letter.
