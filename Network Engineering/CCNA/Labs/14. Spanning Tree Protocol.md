# Cheat Sheet

Here is a **command | description** table based on the content of the chapter:

| **Command** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| `show spanning-tree` | Displays the spanning tree status, including root bridge ID, local switch ID, and port roles. |
| `spanning-tree vlan <vlan-id> priority <priority-value>` | Configures a switchâ€™s bridge priority for STP election (must be in increments of 4096). |
| `spanning-tree vlan <vlan-id> root primary` | Sets the switch as the primary root bridge if possible by adjusting priority. |
| `spanning-tree vlan <vlan-id> root secondary` | Sets the switch as the backup root bridge with a priority of 28672. |
| `spanning-tree portfast` | Enables PortFast on a switch port, allowing it to skip the listening and learning states. |
| `spanning-tree portfast default` | Enables PortFast on all access ports (not trunk ports) globally. |
| `spanning-tree bpduguard enable` | Enables BPDU Guard on a port, disabling it if a BPDU is received. |
| `spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default` | Globally enables BPDU Guard on all PortFast-enabled ports. |
| `spanning-tree vlan <vlan-id> port-priority <priority-value>` | Adjusts the port priority to influence root port selection. |
| `spanning-tree vlan <vlan-id> cost <cost-value>` | Manually sets the STP cost for a port to influence root port selection. |
| `show spanning-tree detail` | Provides detailed STP information, including BPDU counts and changes. |
| `show spanning-tree interface <interface>` | Displays STP information for a specific port. |
| `shutdown` / `no shutdown` | Disables and re-enables a port, useful for clearing error-disabled states. |

### **Cisco Packet Tracer Lab Walkthrough: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Implementation**

#### **Objective:**
- Understand how STP prevents Layer 2 loops.
- Configure STP on Cisco switches.
- Observe STP behavior and port roles.
- Implement PortFast and BPDU Guard for access ports.

---

### **Lab Topology**
#### **Devices Required:**
- **3 Cisco 2960 Switches** (SW1, SW2, SW3)
- **2 PCs** (PC1, PC2)
- **Cables:** Copper straight-through for PC-to-Switch connections, Copper crossover for Switch-to-Switch connections.

#### **Network Diagram:**
```
          [PC1]                          [PC2]
             |                               |
        (F0/1)                          (F0/1)
          SW1 --------- SW2 --------- SW3
            \                         /
             \----------------------/
```

### **Step 1: Setting Up the Network**
1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Drag **3 Cisco 2960 switches** onto the workspace.
3. Drag **2 PCs** onto the workspace.
4. Connect the devices:
   - **PC1 to SW1 (F0/1)** using a **straight-through cable**.
   - **PC2 to SW3 (F0/1)** using a **straight-through cable**.
   - **SW1 to SW2 (F0/2 to F0/2)** using a **crossover cable**.
   - **SW2 to SW3 (F0/3 to F0/3)** using a **crossover cable**.
   - **SW1 to SW3 (F0/4 to F0/4)** using a **crossover cable**.

---
### **Step 2: Configuring STP on the Switches**
1. **Access each switch via CLI**:
   - Click on a switch.
   - Go to the **CLI** tab.
   - Type `enable` to enter privileged mode.

2. **Set SW1 as the root bridge**:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 0
   exit
   ```

3. **Verify the root bridge election**:
   ```bash
   show spanning-tree
   ```
   - Look for the **Root ID** section. The switch with the lowest **Bridge ID** (Priority + MAC Address) is the root bridge.
   - If SW1 is correctly set as the root bridge, it should display:  
     ```
     This bridge is the root
     ```

4. **Check STP port states on all switches**:
   ```bash
   show spanning-tree
   ```
   - Ports should show different roles: **Root Port (RP), Designated Port (DP), and Blocking (BLK)**.

---
### **Step 3: Testing STP Blocking State**
1. **Observe the port blocking behavior**:
   - One of the links between **SW1, SW2, and SW3** should be in the **Blocking** state to prevent loops.
   - Use:
     ```bash
     show spanning-tree
     ```
   - Identify which port is **Blocking**.

2. **Disconnect the Blocking Link**:
   - Disconnect the cable of the blocking port.
   - Wait for STP to **recalculate** and unblock an alternative path.
   - Re-run:
     ```bash
     show spanning-tree
     ```
   - Verify that another port has moved to **Forwarding** state.

---
### **Step 4: Configuring PortFast & BPDU Guard**
1. **Enable PortFast on Access Ports (PC1 and PC2 connections)**:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface fastethernet 0/1
   spanning-tree portfast
   exit
   ```

2. **Enable BPDU Guard on Access Ports**:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface fastethernet 0/1
   spanning-tree bpduguard enable
   exit
   ```

3. **Test BPDU Guard**:
   - **Incorrectly connect SW1 F0/1 to SW2 F0/1** (Instead of PC).
   - Run:
     ```bash
     show spanning-tree
     ```
   - The port should enter **err-disabled state**.

4. **Recover the disabled port**:
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   interface fastethernet 0/1
   shutdown
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

---
### **Step 5: Testing Network Connectivity**
1. **Assign IP addresses to PCs**:
   - Click **PC1**, go to **Desktop > IP Configuration**, and set:
     ```
     IP Address: 192.168.1.1
     Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
     ```
   - Click **PC2**, set:
     ```
     IP Address: 192.168.1.2
     Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
     ```

2. **Ping from PC1 to PC2**:
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.2
   ```
   - If STP is working correctly, the connection should be successful.

### **Step 6: Summary of Commands Used**
| **Command** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| `show spanning-tree` | Displays STP status, roles, and port states. |
| `spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 0` | Sets the switch as the root bridge. |
| `spanning-tree portfast` | Enables PortFast on an access port. |
| `spanning-tree bpduguard enable` | Enables BPDU Guard to disable ports receiving BPDUs. |
| `shutdown` / `no shutdown` | Disables and re-enables a port. |

---
### **Completion & Expected Outcome**
By the end of this lab, you should:
âœ… Understand **how STP prevents Layer 2 loops**.  
âœ… Identify **root ports, designated ports, and blocked ports**.  
âœ… Configure **PortFast and BPDU Guard** to optimize network performance.  
âœ… Verify that **STP recalculates the topology** when a failure occurs.
