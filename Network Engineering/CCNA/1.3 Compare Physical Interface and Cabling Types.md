## Theory in short

### Understanding Network Cables and Standards in Simple Terms

Imagine a busy highway where cars travel between cities. These cars represent data, and the highways are the cables that connect computers and devices. To ensure smooth travel, there must be rules (or standards) in place that dictate how data should move, just like traffic laws ensure cars don’t crash.

In networking, two main "highways" exist:
1. **Copper cables (UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair)**: Think of these as regular roads where cars (data) travel using electrical signals.
2. **Fiber-optic cables**: These are like high-speed railways where data moves using light, allowing for much faster and longer-distance travel.

Computers use binary (0s and 1s) to communicate, and this data is sent over these cables at high speeds. Different standards define how fast data can move, and different types of cables are used depending on the needs of the network.

### Key Takeaways
- **Ethernet** is the most common way devices connect using cables.
- **Copper cables (UTP)** are cheaper but have distance limitations (max 100m).
- **Fiber-optic cables** can transfer data over long distances using light.
- **Binary (0s and 1s)** is the basic language computers use to communicate.
- **Auto MDI-X** is a feature that allows devices to automatically adjust how they send and receive data, reducing the need for different types of cables.
