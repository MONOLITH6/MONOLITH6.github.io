## Theory in short
A network is a system that connects different devices (nodes) so they can share resources and communicate. Examples of networks include the internet, business networks, and home networks. A computer network consists of various devices such as clients, servers, switches, routers, and firewalls.

- **Clients**: Devices that request services (e.g., your laptop accessing a website).
- **Servers**: Devices that provide services (e.g., a web server hosting a webpage).
- **Switches**: Devices that connect multiple devices in a local area network (LAN) and facilitate internal communication.
- **Routers**: Devices that connect different networks and direct data between them, such as connecting a home network to the internet.
- **Firewalls**: Security devices that filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.
